        <p>
         The <term>Euclidean plane</term> or <term>rectangular coordinate system</term> is formed by two perpendicular copies 
         of the real line intersecting at the number <m>0</m> of each line.  Each number line is called an <term>axis</term>.  
         A point in the plane, called an  <term>ordered pair</term>, is specified by (horizontal position, vertical position). 
         The horizontal axis is often labeled <m>x</m> and the vertical axis <m>y</m>. The point <m>(0,0)</m> is called the 
         <term>origin</term>. The plane is divided into 4 quadrants, as pictured below.    
        </p>

       <p>
        The labeling of the horizontal and vertical axes are arbitrary. We can use whatever letters or symbols we want to name or identify 
        each axis. However they are labled, ordered pairs will always have the form (horizontal position, vertical position). In the graph above 
        each ordered pair has the form <m>(x,y)</m>. In the example below, they have the form <m>(t,P)</m>. 
       </p>      

       <example>
        ADTF Distributors is a global distributor, supplier, producer, and manufacturer of a variety of goods and services with offices,
        plants, and warehouses all over the world. In the graph below, <m>t</m> represents the number of years since 1999 and <m>P</m> represents 
        ADTF Distributors' profit in millions of dollars for the year corresponding to <m>t</m>.

          Interpret the coordinates of point <m>A</m>.
           <solution>
            <m>A = (2,2)</m>, so that <m>t=2</m> and <m>P=2</m>. Since <m>t</m> is the number of years since 1999, <m>t=2</m> corresponds 
            to the year 2001. Since <m>P</m> is ADTF Distributors' profit in millions of dollars, <m>P=2</m> corresponds to a profit of $2,000,000. So, point 
            <m>A = (2,2)</m> in interpreted as: In 2001, ADTF Distributors made a profit of $2,000,000.

            <m>C = (6,0)</m>, so that <m>t=6</m> and <m>P=0</m>. Since <m>t</m> is the number of years since 1999, <m>t=6</m> corresponds 
            to the year 2005. Since <m>P</m> is ADTF Distributors' profit in millions <m>P=0</m> corresponds to a profit of $0. Another way 
            to say a company's profit is $0 (no profit, no loss) is to say that the company broke even. So, point 
            <m>C = (6,0)</m> in interpreted as: In 2005, ADTF Distributors broke even. Note that negative profit will be interpreted as a 
            <em>loss</em>.

        <p>
         When we have an equation with two variables, usually <m>x</m> and <m>y</m>, we can ask if a given point is a solution to 
         that equation.  By the <em>graph of an equation</em>, we mean the collection of all the points <m>(x,y)</m>, 
         that satisfy the equation. As an example, consider the graph labeled <m>L</m> below.
        </p>

        <p>
         <m>L</m> is the visual representation of the graph of <m>4x-2y=-8</m> in the plane.  
         For homework check that each point labeled on the graph satisfies the equation defining <m>L</m>.  
         Note that <m>(0,4)</m> is called the <m>y</m>-intercept and <m>(-2,0)</m> is called the <m>x</m>-intercept (the points where the graph 
         crosses the coordinate axes).  Is the point <m>(5,6)</m> on the graph?  
        </p>

          <example> 
          Check that the points labeled on the graph below satisfy the equation <m> x+y^2 = 9</m>. 
          Determine if <m>(-8,5)</m> is on the graph.

            The <term>standard form</term> of a line is given by <m>Ax+By =C</m> where <m>A,B,</m> and <m>C</m> are real numbers and <m>A</m> 
            and <m>B</m> are not both 0.  Notice that the line <m>L</m> in our previous example was given in standard form.
          </p>

           <example> 
            For this example we work with the line <m>4x-2y=-4</m> given in standard form (identify <m>A,B,</m> and <m>C</m> for homework).
            Let's find points on this line, <m>L</m>, by solving the equation for <m>y</m>.  Verify for homework that <m>4x-2y=-4</m> is the same as 
            <m>y=2x+2</m>. Now we can substitute values for <m>x</m> and compute <m>y</m>:
             <ul>
              <li> When <m>x=1</m>, we have <m>y=2(1)+2=4</m> which gives the point <m>(1,4)</m> on <m>L</m>. </li>
              <li> When <m>x=0</m>, we have <m>y=2(0)+2=2</m> which gives the point <m>(0,2)</m> on <m>L</m>. </li>
              <li> When <m>x=-1</m>, we have <m>y=2(-1)+2=0</m> which gives the point <m>(-1,0)</m> on <m>L</m>. </li>
             </ul>
            All three of these points fall on the same line.  Plot those points and graph this line for homework.

          <p>
           In applied mathematics, the variables in an equation or function (which we will get to later) are assigned a meaning. 
           In this case, these equations or functions are called <term>mathematical models</term>. For example, equations representing a 
           company's revenue, cost, and profit are often referred to as models.
          </p>

           <example xml:id="ex-rev-slope"> 
             Suppose a company's revenue is modeled by a line where points on the line have the form 
             (units sold, revenue dollars).  If the company makes \$14.25 from selling 3 units and if they sell 6 units they 
             make $28.50, find the slope of the line representing this company's revenue model.

             <solution>
              2 points on this line are <m>(3,14.25)</m> and <m>(6,28.50)</m>. So, 
              <me>
               m = \frac{28.50-14.25}{6-3}= \frac{14.25}{3} = 4.75.
              </me>
              Notice that we can assign units to the slope in this problem:  
              <m>\frac{\textrm{dollars}}{\textrm{units}}</m>. This helps us see the slope of a line as a rate of change, 
              an important concept in calculus.  In this problem we now see that this company makes 
              $4.75 per each additional unit sold. The graph is below.

         <title>Slope-Intercept Form of a Line</title>
          <p>
           Suppose a line has slope <m>m</m> and <m>y</m>-intercept <m>(0,b)</m>.  If <m>(x,y)</m> is any other point on the line then
           <me>
            m = \frac{m}{1} = \frac{y-b}{x-0}
           </me>
           Cross multiplying and solving for <m>y</m> we get 
           <me>
           y = mx + b
           </me>
           This is called the <term>slope-intercept form</term> of a line. In this context, we call <m>x</m> the <term>independent variable</term>,
           or <em>input variable</em> and <m>y</m> the <term>dependent variable</term>,
           or <em>output variable</em>. Using this language and recalling <xref ref="def-slope" />, we can interpret the slope as the change in ouput per the change in input. For instance, if the 
           slope of a line is <m>m = \frac{3}{4} = .75</m> we say the output increase by 3 units as the input increases by 4 units. 
           Equivalently, this means the output increases by .75 units as the input increases by 1 unit. Recalling <xref ref="ex-rev-slope" /> in which we found <m>m=4.75</m>, 
           we can say this company's revenue (the <em>output</em>) increases by $14.25 as the number of units sold (the <em>input</em>) inreases by 3. Equivalently, 
           the company's revenue (the <em>output</em>) increases by $4.75 as the number of units sold increases by 1.

         <example> Graph <m>3x + 4y =4</m> using the <m>y</m>-intercept and the slope. 
          <solution>
          We rewrite this in slope-intercept form to
          get <m>y=-\frac{3}{4}x +1</m>.  So, the slope is <m>m=-\frac{3}{4}</m> and the <m>y</m>-intercept is <m>(0,1)</m>.  
          Starting at <m>(0,1)</m>, to get to another point on the line we can move up 3 units then left 4 units to get to 
          the point <m>(-4,4)</m> or down 3 units then right 4 units to arrive at the point <m>(4,-2)</m>.

         If it costs them $30 to produce 2 items and their cost increases at a constant rate of $4 per additional unit produced, 
         find the equation of the line modeling the company's cost in slope intercept form.
          <solution>
           We are given the point <m>(2,30)</m> and slope <m>m=4</m>.  The line has the form <m>y=mx+b</m>, 
           and substituting <m>m=4</m> we have <m>y=4x+b</m>.  We can solve for <m>b</m> by substituting <m>x=2</m> and <m>y=30</m>.

          <example>
           Jane drives for a ride sharing service. Passengers are charged an $8.75 pickup fee and then pay an additional \$2.25 per 
           mile traveled.  Find a linear equation to model the charge for a single ride.  Use your model to determine how far a passenger
           traveled in Jane's car if they paid $33.50. 
            <solution>
             Let
              <ul>
               <li> <m>C</m> = total charge in dollars for a ride in Jane's car </li>
               <li>  <m>d</m> = distance traveled in miles </li>
              </ul>   
             <p>   
             We need a model in the form <m>C=md+b</m>.  Notice that passengers are responsible for the pickup fee of $8.75 with <m>d=0</m> 
             miles traveled.  So, we know the point <m>(0, 8.75)</m> is on the line (which is the <m>C</m> (or vertical) intercept).  
             We are also given that passengers pay 
              <me>
               \dfrac{2.25 \: \textrm{dollars}}{1 \: \textrm{mile}} = \dfrac{\Delta C}{\Delta d}
              </me>
             which means that 2.25 is the slope, <m>m</m>. The desired model is 
               <me>
                C = 2.25d + 8.75
               </me>
             In this problem, the <em>input variable</em> is <m>d</m>, which represents the distance traveled in Jane's car in miles. 
             The <em>output variable</em>, <m>C</m>, is the total charge in dollars for riding <m>d</m> miles in Jane's car.

          Tyler's company is making t-shirts to sell at the IUP football games this season. His fixed costs
          are $800 and he has variable costs of $3 per shirt. He will sell the shirts for $14 at the games.

            <li>  Find an equation for <m>C</m>, the total cost to produce <m>x</m> shirts.          
             <solution> 
              As we will discuss again later, the linear cost model will have the form <me>C = \textrm{variable costs} + \textrm{fixed costs}. </me>  
              Since <m>x</m> represents the number, or quantity, of t-shirts, the variable cost is <m>3x</m>. With the fixed costs given, the cost model

               C = 3x + 800
              </me> 
              In this context, the <em>input variable</em> is <m>x</m>, which represents the number or quantity of t-shirts Tyler's

             <solution>
              Using the above linear model and evaluating at <m>x=80</m> gives
              <me>
               C = 3(80)+800 = 1040

             <solution> As we will discuss again later, the linear revenue model will have the form <me> R = \textrm{(price)(quantity)}. </me>  
               So, the revenue model for Tyler's company is  <me> R = 14x </me>. In this context, the <em>input variable</em> is <m>x</m>, 
               which represents the number or quantity of t-shirts Tyler's company produces and sells. The <em>output variable</em>,

         <term>Supply and demand</term> refers to the relationship between the quantity of a commodity that producers wish to sell at 
         various prices and the quantity that consumers wish to buy at various prices. It is the main model of price determination 
         used in economic theory. The price of a commodity is determined by the interaction of supply and demand in a market. 
         The resulting price is referred to as the <term>equilibrium price</term> and represents an agreement between producers and 
         consumers of the good. In equilibrium the quantity of a good supplied by producers equals the quantity demanded by consumers. 
         This, of course, is referred to as the  <term>equilibrium quantity</term>.

         Freeze Frame camera company supplies 50 cameras when the price is $175.69; when the price is $275.19, 100 of these cameras are 
         available.  Let <m>p</m> represent the price of each camera and <m>q</m> the quanity, or number of, cameras sold. Assme that Freeze Frame's
         supply model is linear and expressed as <m>p = mq + b</m>.   
          <ol marker="(a)">
           <li> Using the inforamtion above, idenitfy two data points given by Freeze Frame's linear supply model. 
            <solution> 
             Since the linear model is given as <m>p = mq + b</m>, points on this line would have the form <m>(q,p)</m>. That is, the quantity <m>q</m> 
             of cameras supplied by Freeze Frame represents the <em>input variable</em>, giving the horizontal location of a point. The price <m>p</m> of 
             each camera represents the <em>output variable</em> giving the vertical location of a point. Therefore, the given data can be expressed as 
             the ordered pairs
              <me>
               (50,175.69) \: \textrm{and} \: (100,275.19)

           </li>

           <li> Find Freeze Frame's linear supply model. 
            <solution>
             We need the slope <m>m</m> and <m>p</m>-intercept.
              <me>
               m = \frac{275.19-175.69}{100-50} =  1.99           
              </me>
             This means that for each additional camera suppled, the supply price increases by $1.99

             <p>
             To find the <m>p</m>-intercept we use the point-slope form of a line:
              <md>
                <mrow> p - p_1 \amp = m(q - q_1) </mrow>
                <mrow> p - 175.69 \amp = 1.99(q - 50) </mrow>
                <mrow> p \amp = 1.99q + 76.19 </mrow>
              </md>
             </p>

             <p>
              Finally, we have determined that Freeze Frame's linear supply model is 
             </p>

              <me>
               p=1.99q + 76.19
              </me>
            </solution>
           </li>

           <li> Suppose the demand for Freeze Frame cameras is given by <m>p =-1.27q+350</m> where again 
                 <m>p</m> is price and <m>q </m> the quantity. Determine the equilibrium price and quantity.
            <solution>
             Setting supply equal to demand we solve
              <me>
                1.99q +76.19 = -1.27q + 350
              </me>
             to get an equilibrium quantity of <m>q=84</m> (after roudning) and an equilibrium price of <m>p=</m> $243.35. That is,
             the market for Freeze Frame cameras will be at equilibrium when 84 cameras (the equilibrium quantity) are supplied
             at a price of $243.35 (the equilbrium price). So, the equilibrium point is <m>(84, 243.35)</m>

           <em>Simple Interest</em> is a very common linear model, used in an example below.  Let <m>P=</m> principal amount invested or borrowed, <m>r=</m> annual interest

      <definition>
      A <term>function</term> is a rule from a set, called the <term>domain</term> of the function, to another set, called the 
      <term>range</term> of the function, such that each member of the domain is assigned to one and only one member of the range.
      </definition>

      <p>
       A function will often be given by an equation such as <m>y=2x+3</m>.  Notice that by the way this equation is written, <m>y</m> depends on <m>x</m>.  
       In this case <m>y</m> is called the <term>dependent</term>, or <em>output variable</em>, and <m>x</m> is called the <term>independent</term>,
       or <em>input variable</em>. We can express this using function notation where we replace the output variable with some other letter representing 
       the function, like <m>f</m>, and express its dependency on the input variable using parentheses.  In this case we replace <m>y</m> with <m>f(x)</m> 
       (read <m>f</m> of <m>x</m>) and we have 
        <me>
         y = f(x) = 2x+3.
        </me> 
      </p>
     
      <p>
       This makes evaluation easy to express.  In this case, for domain (or input) values <m>x=1</m> and <m>x=2</m> we have the 
       corresponding range (or output) values 
        <ul>
         <li> <m>f(1)=2(1)+3=5</m> </li>
         <li> <m>f(2)=2(2)+3=7</m> </li>
        </ul>
       So, for input value <m>x=1</m>, we have an output value <m>y=f(1)=5</m>, and for 
       input value <m>x=2</m>, we have an output value <m>y=f(2)=7</m>.

       We will use the following notation. For a funciton <m>f(x)</m>, 
        <ul>
         <li> dom(<m>f</m>) = the domain of the function <m>f</m> </li>

        </ul>
       Typcially, we will express these sets using <em>interval notation</em>. Note that the set of all real numbers can expressed using
       the notation <m> \mathbb{R} = (-\infty, \infty)</m>.

         <li> <m>p(t) = \dfrac{1}{t+3}</m>
          <solution> Here, it is easier to think about what values of <m>t</m> are NOT permissible as input values. Since 
           division by 0 is NOT allowed, <m>t=-3</m> is the only value NOT permitted as an input value and we have

     <title>Graphs of Functions</title>

      <p>
       Points on the graph of a function <m>f(x)</m> have the form <m>(x,f(x))</m> where <m>x</m> is in the domain of <m>f</m>.  
       Notice that these points have the form (domain value, range value).  So, the domain values are on the <m>x</m>, or horizontal axis, 
       and the range values are on the <m>y</m>, or vertical, axis. The points where the graph touches or crosses an axis are called 
       <term> intercepts </term>. 
      </p>

      <example>
      Use the graph of <m>f(x)</m> below to answer the following questions.  Note that both ends of the graph (on the left and right) 
      continue to go downwards forever.

         <li> Find <m>f(-1)</m>.
          <solution>
           <m>f(-1) = 2</m> since the point <m>(-1,2)</m> is on the graph of <m>f(x)</m>.

         <li>Find the <m>x</m>-intercept(s) or determine that there are none.
          <solution>
           Since the horizontal axis is labeled <m>x</m>, these are the points where the graph crosses the horizontal axis. These points are

         <li>Find the domain of <m>f(x)</m>.
          <solution>
           We look at the horizontal (or <m>x</m>) axis to determine this. Since every number on the <m>x</m>-axis has a point above 
           or below it on the graph (think about drawing vertical lines through numbers  on the horizontal axis), 
           <m>\textrm{dom}(f) = \mathbb{R} = (-\infty,\infty)</m>.
          </solution>
         </li>

         <li>Find the range of <m>f(x)</m>.
          <solution>
           We look at the vertical (or <m>y</m>) axis to determine this. Since every number below and including 5 on the 
           <m>y</m>-axis has a point on the graph to the right or left of it (think about drawing horizontal lines through numbers  on the 
           vertical axis) <m>\textrm{rng}(f) = (-\infty,5]</m>.

        </ol>
      </example>

      <p>
       Remember that if <m>f</m> is a function between sets, then input values correspond uniquely to output values. In other words, for every
       input value, there is only one ouptput value. Geometrically, this means that if you locate a domain value on the horizontal axis of the graph of 
       <m>f</m>, then there is exactly one point on the vertical line through that domain value. This gives us the following geometric test to 
       determine if a graph represents a function.
      </p>

      <p>
      <term>The Vertical Line Test (VLT)</term>: A graph represents a function if and only if any vertical line intersects the graph AT MOST once.
      </p>

      <example>
      Use the VLT to determine if the graphs represent a function.

        <li> Graph given below.
          <image source="ch-1/7.png" width="100%">
          </image>
            Because any vertical line will intersect this graph at most once, this graph represents a function. Note that there are open circles 
           at the points <m>(-10,10)</m> and <m>(0,20)</m>. For homeowork find the domain and range of this function.

        <li> Graph given below.
          <image source="ch-1/8.png" width="100%">

           Because a vertical line can be drawn that intersects this graph more than once (for instance <m>x=4</m>), this graph DOES NOT
           represent a function.

     <section xml:id="linear-functions">
     <title>Linear Functions and Applications</title>>
     
     <definition>
     A function of the form <m>f(x) = mx + b</m> where <m>m</m> and <m>b</m> are constants is called a <term>linear function</term>.  
     </definition>

     <p>
      Observe that without a context given, the domain and range of any linear function is <m> \mathbb{R} = (-\infty,\infty)</m>. 
     </p>

     <p>
      The examples in this section will be similar to those in <xref ref="linear-models-applications" /> except now we will express
      linear models using function notation. For instance, <m>y = mx + b</m> will instead be written as <m>f(x) = mx + b</m> where we call <m>x</m>
      the <em>input variable</em> (horizontal axis) and <m>f</m> or <m>f(x)</m> the <em>output variable</em> (vertical axis). 
     </p>

     <p>
      Observe that the <em> slope </em>, <m> m </m>, of a linear function gives the function's <em>rate of change</em>. Conversely, every 
      <em>rate of change</em> can be viewed as the <em> slope </em> of a lline. Being able to interpret 
      a slope as a rate of change will be extrememly important in many examples. For instance, if <m>g(t) = -3t +5</m> then the slope 
      <m>m = -3 = \dfrac{-3}{1}</m> means that  the output variable <m>g</m>, or <m>g(t)</m>, decreases by 3 units 
      as the input variable <m>t</m> increases by 1 unit. Since many problems will be applications, you should also be able to 
      associate units with the slope to help with interpretation. Again, with <m>g(t) = -3t +5</m>, 
       <me>
        m = \dfrac{-3}{1} \: \dfrac{\textrm{units of g}}{\textrm{units of t}}.
       </me>
     So, if <m>g(t)</m> gives the value of an asset in hundreds of dollars, and <m>t</m> represents time in years, then we 
     interpret <m>m=-3</m> as: The value of asset decreases by 3 hundred dollars (the change in <m>g</m> ) per each additional year 
     (the change in <m>t</m>).
     </p>
     
     <p>
     Recall the definitions of <em>cost, revenue,</em> and <em>profit</em> given in <xref ref="linear-models-applications" />. We now look
     at these basic business relationships as linear functions. To fix ideas, suppose below that cost, revenue, and profit are dollar 
     amounts that depend on a certain number of items produced. 
     </p>

      <ul>
       <li> Cost Function = (cost per item)(number of items) + fixed costs </li>
       <li> Revenue Function = (price per item)(number of items) </li>
       <li> Profit Function = Revenue Function - Cost Function</li>
      </ul>
      
     <p>
     Suppose that <m>k=</m>cost per item, <m>p=</m>price per item, and <m>F=</m>fixed costs. Using <m>C, R</m> and <m>P</m> respectively
     for cost, revenue, and profit, and <m>x=</m>number of items as the input variable, we have
     </p>

      <ul>
       <li> Cost Function = <m>C(x) = kx + F</m> </li>
       <li> Revenue Function = <m>R(x) = px</m> </li>
       <li> Profit Function = <m>P(x) = R(x) - C(x) </m></li>
      </ul>
     
     <p>
     So, with respect to the defintions given above, to find the number of units a company should produce and sell to <em>break-even</em>,
     you solve <m>R(x) = C(x)</m> or equivalently, <m>P(x) = 0</m>.
     </p>
     <p>
      While the following functions are NOT linear, it is worth defining them here as they will appear in many examples. 
     </p>

      <ul>
        <li> Average Cost <m>=\bar{C}(x) = \dfrac{C(x)}{x}</m></li>
        <li> Average Revenue <m>=\bar{R}(x) = \dfrac{R(x)}{x}</m></li>
        <li> Average Profit <m>=\bar{P}(x) = \dfrac{P(x)}{x}</m></li>
      </ul>
     
     <p>
     Note that in all the functions discussed above, we used <m>x=</m>number of items as the input variable. Another common input 
     variable for these business functions is <m>t=</m>some unit of time. Also, the output units of these functions may be, say,
     thousands of dollars instead of dolllars. Make sure you read each problem carefully and understand the role each variable is playing.
     </p>

     <example>
       The pharmaceutical company CVL produces an antidepressant drug that can be made for $10.75 per unit, <m>d</m>. They sell this 
       same drug for $24.53 per unit, <m>d</m>. Their total cost for producing <m>d=98</m> units is $1523.82.
         <ol marker="(a)">
           <li> 
             Find CVL's cost function, <m>C(d)</m>, for this antidepressant drug. 
              <solution>
               With the cost per unit given as $10.75, we have 
                <me>
                 C(d) = 10.75d + F
                </me>
               To find <m>F</m> we use the fact that CVL's total cost for producing <m>d=98</m> units is $1523.82. That is
                <me>
                  C(98) = 10.75(98) + F = 1523.82    
                </me>
               which gives <m>F= 470.32</m> so that
                <me>
                  C(d) = 10.75d + 470.32
                </me>
               From the cost model above we see that CVL's fixed costs are $470.32 Observe also that the cost per unit is the slope
               <m>m=10.75</m> of <m>C(d)</m>. So, CVL's cost increase by $10.75 for every addtional unit of the antidresspant drug they produce.

                <p>
                 Make sure you are aware of the role the variables play when you work through these examples. For this model, the input variable
                 is <m>d</m> which represents the number of units of the antidepressant drug produced by CVL. The output variable is <m>C(d)</m>
                 which represents CVL's cost in dollars for producing <m>d</m> units of the antidpressant drug. You should take a minute to 
                 identify the variables and write a sentence to describe them as you work through all these examples.
                </p>
              </solution>
           </li>

           <li>
            Find CVL's revenue function, <m>R(d)</m>, for this antidepressant drug. 
             <solution>
             With the price per unit given as <m>p=$24.53</m>, CVL'S revenue function for this drug is
              <me>
               R(d) = 24.53d
              </me>
             Notice that the price per unit is the slope <m>m=24.53</m> of the revenue model. This means 
             CVL's revenue increases by $24.53 for every addtional unit of the antidresspant drug they produce and sell.
             </solution>
           </li> 
               
           

            <li> 
             Find the CVL's profit model, <m>P(d)</m>. Then find and interpret the average profit from producing and selling 
             <m>d = 272</m> units of the antidepressant drug 
              <solution>
               We subract the cost function from the revenue function:
               <md>
                 <mrow> P(d) \amp = R(d) - C(d) </mrow>
                 <mrow> P(d) \amp = 24.53d - (10.75d+470.32) </mrow>
                 <mrow> P(d) \amp = 13.78d-470.32 </mrow>
               </md>
               Notice that the slope of the profit model is <m>m=13.78</m>. This means 
               CVL's profit increases by $13.78 for every addtional unit of the antidresspant drug they produce and sell.

               <p>
                 Now, <m>P(272) = 3,277.84</m>, which means CVL's profit from producing and selling 272 units of the antidepressant
                 drug is $3,277.84. To calculate the average profit we divide this by the number of units: 
                  <me>
                   \textrm{Average Profit} = \dfrac{P(272)}{272} = 12.05 
                  </me> 
                 So, CVL's average profit from producing and selling <m>d=272</m> units of the antidresspant drug is $12.05 per unit or
                  <me> 
                    12.05 \dfrac{\textrm{dollars}}{\textrm{unit of the drug}}   
                  </me>  
                 Notice that the units for average profit (as well as average cost and average revenue) are  
                  <me>
                   \dfrac{\textrm{units of output}}{\textrm{units of input}}.
                  </me>        
               </p>
             </solution>
            </li>
             
            <li> 
             How many units of the drug should CVL produce and sell in order to break even? 
             <solution>
              The break-even point occurs when CVL's profit is $0. So, we solve
               <md>
                <mrow> P(d) \amp = 0 </mrow>
                <mrow> 13.78d -470.32 \amp = 0 </mrow>
                <mrow> d \amp = 34.13 </mrow>
               </md>
              Recall that we always round up to identify the break-even point. So, CVL must produce and sell <m>d=35</m> units
              of the antidepressant drug to break even. See the figure below for an illustration of the models and break-even point.

     <example>
      Cosmo recently purchased a Honda Civic for $24,535. The value of the car is estimated to be $17,020 in 3 years from the purchase date.  
      Assuming linear depreciation, find the depreciation model <m>D(t)</m> for this Honda Civic, where <m>D</m> is the value of the car in dollars 
      <m>t</m> years after the car was purchased by Cosmo.  Then find the value of the car in 5 years.
       <solution>
        <m>D(t)</m> will have the form <m>D(t) = mt +b</m> where the slope <m>m</m> will be the rate of depreciation per year.  Let's start by 
        finding the slope, <m>m</m>.  We are given the data points <m>(0,24535)</m> and <m>(3,17020)</m> so that 
         <me>
          m= \dfrac{24,535-17,020}{0-3} = -2,505
         </me>
         Since we are given the <m>D-</m>intercept (the vertical intercept) we see that
          <me> 
           D(t)=-2,505t + 24,535. 
          </me> 
        In 5  years the car will be worth <m>D(5) = -2,505(5) + 24,535 = $12,010</m>.  Note that <m>m=-2,505</m> means the car depreciates 
        by \$2,505 per year.
       </solution>
     </example>  
     
    <p>
     In the next example we'll be working with what is called a <term>piecewise linear function</term>.  It's called piecewise because 
     the function is split into multiple pieces over difference parts of its domain. When writing a piecewise function the  
     <em>rule</em> identifying the action of the function is indicated on the left, with the corresponding input values to the right. 
     For instance
     
      <me>
        Q(x) = \left\{
         \begin{array}{ll}
           2x + 1, \quad 0 \leq x \leq 20 \\ \\
           -x + 30, \quad 20 &lt; x \leq 45
         \end{array}
          \right.  
      </me>
        
        says that <m>Q(x)=2x+1</m> only when <m>0 \leq x \leq 20</m> and <m>Q(x)=-x+30</m> only when 
        <m>20 &lt; x \leq 45</m>. To evaluate, we have to identify which piece to  use:
         <ul>
          <li>To evaluate at <m>x=9</m>, we observe that <m>0 \leq 9 \leq 20</m> so <m>Q(9) = 2(9) + 1 = 19</m> </li>
          <li>To evaluate at <m>x=35</m>, we observe that <m>20 &lt; 35 \leq 45</m> so <m>Q(35) = -35 + 30 = -5</m> </li>
         </ul>
     </p>
     
     <p>
      The graph of <m>Q(x)</m> is below. Observe that the domain values that correspond to each piece of <m>Q(x)</m> are identified 
      using dotted lines along the horizontal axis. Why is there an open circle identifyng the piont <m>(20,10)</m>?

       ADTF Distributors produces and sells Doggie DNA Kits to determine dog genetics.  They find that that their annual net profit, in

        <ol marker="(a)">
          <li>
            In 2010 ADTF Distributors' profit from producing and selling Doggie DNA Kits was $10,042. Their profit was $21,634 in 2016.
            Find ADTF Distributors' linear profit model between these years.

              We are given the data points <m>(0,100.42)</m> and <m>(6,216.34)</m>. Finding the line through these points we see that ADTF

      Recall that every rate of change is the slope of line and vice versa. In particular, if <m>f(x) = mx+b</m> then the rate of
      change of <m>f(x)</m> is its slope, <m>m</m> (that is, if the input <m>x</m> increases by 1 unit, then the output <m>f(x)</m>
      changes <m>m</m> units). In business, <term>marginal analysis</term> compares the additional benefits (revenue and profit) derived 
      from an activity and the extra cost incurred by the same activity. These additaional benefits/costs are referred to as 
      <term>marginal revenue</term>, <term>marginal profit</term>, and <term>marginal cost</term>.

     As an example, Vandelay Industries, a global importer and exporter of fine latex goods, determines their profit in thousands of dollars
     from the years 2006 to 2020 can be model by <m>P(t) = 38.46t + 161.54</m> where <m>t</m> is the number of years since 2006. Looking at 
     the slope of <m> P(t) </m>, we see that Vandelay Industries' profit increased at a constant rate of $38,460 per year from 2006 to 2020. So,
     Vandelay Industries' margainal profit from 2006 to 2020 was $38,460 per year. That is, from 2006 to 2007 Vandelay Industries' profit 
     increased by $38,460, from 2007 to 2008 their profit increased by $38,460, from 2008 to 2009 their profit increased by $38,460, etc.
     If we let <m>MP(t)</m> denote the marginal profit function,
     we have <m> MP(t) = 38.46 </m> (a constant function). 
     </p>

     <p>
     If a company's cost, revenue, or profit model is linear, then the corresponding marginal function will simply be the slope 
     (as we found in the example above). The units for the output values of the marginal functions will therefore be same as those 
     for the slope of the original business model. In subsequent chapters we will see that if our business model is NOT linear, the 
     correspondong marginal function will in general NOT be constant.

      <ol marker="(a)">

        Find ADTF Distributors' cost model, in dollars, for these dining room chairs.

          We are given the data points <m>(255,11462)</m> and <m>(520,21400)</m>. Finding the line through these two points and letting

          First, ADTF Distributors' marginal cost model is the constant function 
           <me>

           </me>
          Therefore,<m> MC(372) = 37.5</m> meaning: When ADTF Distributors manufactures <m>x=372</m> dining room chairs, their cost

     <title>Basics About Quadratics</title>

      <definition>
       A <term>quadratic function</term> is a function that can be written in the form <m>f(x) = ax^2 + bx +c</m> where <m>a,b</m>, 
       and <m>c</m> are constants called <term>coefficients</term> and <m>a \neq 0</m>.  The graph of a quadratic function is called 
       a <term>parabola</term>. 
      </definition> 

      <p>
       Every parabola has a <em>high</em> or <em>low</em> point called the <term>vertex</term>.  The vertical line through the vertex is
       called the <term>axis of symmetry</term>.  Note that every quadratic function has a maximum or minimum output value, depending 
       on the direction the parabola opens.  This max or min value is the <m>y</m>-coordinate of the vertex.  Also note that a quadratic 
       could have 0,1, or 2 <m>x</m>-intercepts.  See the picture below for a couple examples.  If a quadratic has one <m>x</m>-intercept, 
       notice that it must be the vertex.
        <image source="ch-1/11.png" width="100%">  
        </image>
      </p>  
      
      <p>
       Following are some facts about the quadratic <m>f(x)= ax^2 +bx + c</m> and its graph:
        <ul>
         <li> 
          The parabola opens up if <m>a &gt; 0</m> and down if <m>a &lt; 0</m>
         </li> 
         <li> 
          <m>\textrm{Vertex} = \left(-\dfrac{b}{2a}, f\left(-\dfrac{b}{2a}\right)\right)</m>
         </li>
         <li> 
          The equation of the axis of the symmetry is <m>x=-\dfrac{b}{2a}</m>
         </li>
         <li> 
          Every quadratic has either a maximum or minimum value given by <m>f\left(-\dfrac{b}{2a}\right)</m>.
         </li>
         <li> 
          Parabolas can have 0,1, or 2 <m>x</m>-intercepts.  To find them, if any exist, solve <m>f(x) = 0</m>
         </li>
        </ul>


       The last bullet point above says that to find the <m>x-</m>intercepts of a quadratic, you solve the quadratic 
       equation <m>ax^2 + bx + c = 0</m>. Remember that solutions can always be found (or determined not to exist as real numbers) using
       the quadratic formula
        <me>
         x=\dfrac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}
        </me> 
      </p>

      <p>
       Consider the quadratic <m>f(x)= x^2 + 4x +3</m>. This parabola opens up since <m>a=1 &gt; 0</m>. Beacuse the parabola opens up
       <m>f(x)</m> has a minimum output value given by the <m>y-</m>coordinate of the vertex. Let's find the vertex. Using the formula given
       above for the <m>x-</m>coordinate (with <m>a=1</m> and  <m>b=4</m>) gives
        <me>
         x = -\dfrac{4}{2 \cdot 1} = - 2
        </me> 
       Evaluating, the <m>y-</m>coordinate is then <m>f(-2) = -1</m> so the vertex is <m>(-2,-1)</m> and we can conclude that <m>f(x)</m>
       has a <em> minimum value </em> value of -1 (the smallest output value). Observe that the <em>axis of symmetry</em> is the vertical
       line <m>x=-2</m>. To find the <m>x-</m>intercepts we solve
        <md>
         <mrow> x^2 + 4x +3 \amp = 0   </mrow>
         <mrow> (x+3)(x+1) \amp = 0   </mrow>
        </md>
       to get <m>x=-3</m> and <m>x=-1</m>. Hence, the <m>x-</m>intercepts are <m>(-3,0)</m> and <m>(-1,0)</m>.
      </p> 

      <p>
       Every quadratic can be written in <term>vertex form</term> <m>f(x) = a(x-h)^2 + k</m>, where <m>(h,k)</m> is the vertex.  
       So, <m>h=-\dfrac{b}{2a}</m> and <m>k=f\left(-\dfrac{b}{2a}\right)</m>.  Using the method of <em>completing the square</em>, the quadratic 
       in the above example has vertex form
        <me>
         f(x) = x^2 + 4x +3 = \left(x^2 + 4x + \left(\dfrac{4}{2}\right)^2\right) + 3 - \left(\dfrac{4}{2}\right)^2 = (x+2)^2 - 1    
        </me>
       so that <m>h=-2</m> and <m>k=-1</m> as expected.

     <title>Applications With Quadratics</title>
     
     <p> 
      Recall the definitions for <term>supply, demand</term> and <term>equilibrium</term> given in <xref ref="linear-models-applications"/>. 
      Both supply and demand functions in some given market relate price <m>p</m> and quantity <m>q</m>, and we often use <m>q</m> as the input 
      variable so that the supply and demand functions have the form <m>p=S(q)</m> and <m>p=D(q)</m>.  The role of these variables can change, however, 
      so make sure you read the problems carefully.
     </p>

     <definition>
      The point at which <m>S(q) = D(q)</m> (supply equals demand) in a market is called the <term>equilibrium point</term>.
     </definition>

     <p>
      Geometrically, the equilibrium point is the piont where the graph of supply and demand intersect. 
     </p>  

     <example>
      Suppose the price and demand for an item are related by <m> p = D(q) = 150 - 6q^2</m> where <m> p = D(q) </m> is the price in 
      dollars and <m>q</m> is the number of items demanded in hundreds.  Suppose also that price and supply are related by 
      <m>p= S(q) = 10q^2 + 2q</m> where <m>p = S(q)</m> is again price in dollars and <m>q</m> is quantity supplied in hundreds.  
      Find the equilibrium price and quantity.
       <solution>
        The equilibrium price and quantity occurs when <m>D(q) = S(q)</m>.  We solve:
         <md>
          <mrow> D(q) \amp = S(q) </mrow>
          <mrow> 150 - 6q^2 \amp = 10q^2 + 2q </mrow>
          <mrow> 16q^2 + 2q - 150 \amp = 0 </mrow>
         </md>
        To solve this equation it is best to use the quadratic formula:
         <me>
          q  = \dfrac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}
         </me>
        Substitute the correct values for <m>a,b</m>, and <m>c</m> for homework.  You should find two solutions:
         <ul>
          <li>
            <m>q = -\dfrac{25}{8}</m> which we can disregard (why?)
          </li>
          <li>
           <m>q=3</m> which is a valid solution for this problem
          </li>
         </ul>
        So, the equilibrium quantity is <m>q=3</m> or 300 items and the equilibrium price is <m>p=D(3) = S(3) = 96</m> or $96.  
        In other words, this market is in equilibrium (supply equals demand) when 300 items are supplied at price of $96. 
        Notice that <m>(3,96)</m>, the equilibrium point, is the intersection point of the graphs of <m>D</m> and <m>S</m>.

          G(t) = 3.2t - .4t^2 + 70.5

      where <m>t</m> represents the number of months after the study began. How many months into the study did gas powered cars reach
      their maximum sales? What was the maximum number of cars sold in a month during the study?
       <solution>
        Since <m>a = -.4 &lt; 0</m>, the quadratic <m>G(t)</m> does indeed have a maximum value. We need the vertex:
         <me>
          t = -\dfrac{b}{2a} = \dfrac{3.2}{(2)(.4)} = 4
         </me>

        You should check that the vertex of parabloa is <m>(4.5, 8.9)</m>. Since the parabola opens up, note that the vetex corresponds to

        At this production level, Sofa King's (minimum) average cost is 8.9 thousand dollars per hundred sofas, or $89 per sofa. 
        Sofa King's cost function is <m>C(s) = s \cdot  \overline{C}(s) = s^3 -9s^2 + 29.15s</m> (in thousands of dollars).

        As a function of <m>x</m>, Kennyland's ticket price is <m>p(x) = 25 + x</m> and quantity is given by <m>q(x) = 40,000 - 1,000x</m>. This means

      Some examples of functions that are NOT polynomials:
       <ul>
        <li> <m> f(x) = \dfrac{2}{x}+4 </m> </li>
        <li> <m> h(t) = t^3 + \sqrt{t} </m> </li>
        <li> <m> r(p)=  3^p - p </m> </li>
       </ul>
      For homework, use <xref ref="poly" /> to explain why the above functions are not polynomials.
     </p>

     <p>
      For the polynomial <m>p(x)</m>, as <m>x</m> approaches <m>\infty</m> or <m>-\infty</m>, <m>p(x)</m> becomes forever 
      increasing or decreasing. This is referred to as the "end behavior" of the polynomial and is entirely determined by the leading term, <m>a_nx^n</m>.
     </p> 

     <p>
      <em>The Leading Term Test</em> tells us that there are 4 possibilities for the end behavior of polynomials, pictured below.  
      The gap inside the dotted lines indicates we cannot predict the behavior of the polynomial near the origin.  
      This test explains what happens to the polynomial at the far ends of the horizontal axis.  The behavior depends on the degree 
      of the polynomial being odd or even, and the sign of the leading coefficient.

      Identify the end behavior of the polynomial <m>p(x) = \dfrac{6}{7}(x-9)^4(x+4)^2(5-3x)</m>
       <solution>
        First you should convince yourself that this is indeed a polynomial.  We just need to identify the leading term, which will be 
        the product of the leading terms of each factor:
         <me>
          \dfrac{6}{7}(x^4)(x^2)(-3x) = -\dfrac{18}{7}x^7
         </me>
        So, the end behavior is as in Case 4 above.
       </solution>

          <li> The total number of turning points (``peaks" and ``valleys") on the graph of <m>p</m> is at most <m>n-1</m> </li>
          <li> The number of  horizontal intercepts on the graph of <m>p</m> is at most <m>n</m>. </li>
        </ul>

     </p> 
     <p> 
      In the graph on the left (for <m>p</m>), the Leading Term Test tells us that deg(<m>p</m>) must be odd.  Now, <m>p</m> has 2 turning 
      points and 3 horizontal intercepts, which means deg(<m>p</m>) <m>\geq 3</m>.
     </p>
     <p> 
      In the graph on the right (for <m>q</m>), the Leading Term Test tells us that deg(<m>q</m>) must be even.  Now, <m>q</m> has 3 turning

     <p>
      For a function <m>f(x)</m>, we wish to investigate how the output values (or <m>f(x)-</m>values) change as the input values 
      (or <m>x-</m>values) ``approach" some fixed number.
     </p>

     <p>
      Notation:  <m>\longrightarrow</m> is read <q>approaches (NOT equals).</q>  For instance <m>x \longrightarrow 1</m> is read 
      <q><m>x</m> approaches 1, <m>x \neq 1</m>.</q>  There are two directions to approach 1 on the number line (from the left and from 
      the right), and the notation <m>x \longrightarrow 1</m> indicates that the <em>two-sided approach</em> is being considered.  
      However, there is also notation to use if you only want to consider a <em>one-sided approach</em>.  
       <ul>
        <li> approach from the left; <m>x \rightarrow 1, x \lt 1 </m>, which is denoted <m>x \rightarrow 1^{-}</m> </li> 
        <li> approach from the right; <m>x \rightarrow 1, x \gt 1</m>, which is denoted <m>x \rightarrow 1^{+}</m> </li>
       </ul>
      The minus and plus symbols, - and +, in the superscript DO NOT indicate the sign of the <m>x-</m>values.  They simply indicate the 
      direction of the approach.  See the picture below.

       <image source="ch-3/c1.png" width="100%">

     </p>  
     <p>
      Observe that <m>\left[ x \rightarrow 1 \right]</m> is the same as <m>\left[ x \rightarrow 1^{-} \: 
      \textbf{AND} \: x \rightarrow 1^{+}\right]</m>   
     </p> 
      
     <p> 
     In the next three examples (<xref ref="ex1xapp1" />,  <xref ref="ex2xapp1" />, and <xref ref="ex3xapp1" />) we will use data charts and 
     graphs to investigate what happens to the given function as 
     <m>x \longrightarrow 1</m>
    </p>

     <example xml:id="ex1xapp1">
      Let <m>f(x) = x+1</m>.  Let's investigate what happens to the <m>f(x)-</m>values as <m>x \longrightarrow 1</m>.
      <p>
       First we look at a data chart:
        <image source="ch-3/c2.png" width="100%">  
        </image>
      </p> 

      <p>
       Even though data charts only allow us to guess what will happen, it seems reasonable to conclude from the above table that 
       <m>f(x) \longrightarrow 2</m> as <m>x \longrightarrow 1</m>.  This is because the <m>f(x)-</m>values approach the SAME NUMBER 
       (which is 2) as <m>x</m> approaches 1 from BOTH SIDES. Let's see if we can make the same conclusion looking at the graph.
      </p>

       <image source="ch-3/c3.png" width="100%">  
       </image>

      <p>
       Looking at the graph we come to same conclusion.  As <m>x \rightarrow 1</m> from either side the corresponding points on the graph 
       of <m>f(x)</m> move (indicated by the dotted arrows) towards the point <m>(1,2)</m>.  Looking at the <m>y-</m>axis (which is 
       where we find the <m>f(x)-</m>values) we see that whether <m>x</m> approaches 1 from the left or right, <m>f(x) \rightarrow 2</m>.  
       Note also that <m>f(1)=2</m> so we actually have <m>f(x) \rightarrow f(1) = 2</m> as <m>x \rightarrow 1</m>.
      </p> 
     </example>

     <example xml:id="ex2xapp1">
      Let <m>f(x) = \dfrac{x^2 -1}{x-1}</m>.  Let's investigate what happens to the <m>f(x)-</m>values as <m>x \longrightarrow 1</m>.
      <p>
       For homework make a data chart as in <xref ref="ex1xapp1" />.  You should again conclude that <m>f(x) \longrightarrow 2</m> 
       as <m>x \longrightarrow 1</m> 
      </p> 

      <p>
       Let's take a look at the graph.  Notice that <m>x=1</m> is not in the domain of this function.  So, we cannot evaluate <m>f(1)</m> 
       as in the previous example.  This also means there will not be a point on the graph above <m>x=1</m> on the graph of <m>f</m>.  
       However, because <m>x \rightarrow 1</m> does not require evaluation at <m>x=1</m>, it still makes sense to talk about what happens 
       as <m>x</m> approaches 1 since <m>f(x)</m> is defined for every <m>x</m> close to 1. Below is the graph.
      </p>

       <image source="ch-3/c4.png" width="100%">  
       </image>

      <p>
       Notice that our conclusion is the same as in the previous example.  Also observe the similarities between the two graphs.  
       This happens because 
       <me>
       f(x) = \dfrac{x^2 -1}{x-1} = \dfrac{(x -1)(x+1)}{x-1} \quad \stackrel{x \neq 1}{=} \quad x+1 
       </me>
       In other words <m>\dfrac{x^2 -1}{x-1} = x+1</m> for every value of <m>x</m> except <m>x=1</m>, which is why both functions approach 
       the same value as <m>x \rightarrow 1</m>.  The difference this time is that <m>f(1)</m> is NOT defined. So, again we 
       <m>f(x) \rightarrow  2</m> as <m>x \rightarrow 1</m>, but this time <m>f(1)</m> is UNDEFINED.   
      </p> 
     </example>

     <example xml:id="ex3xapp1">
      <p>
       Let's again investigate what happens as <m>x \longrightarrow 1</m>, this time to the piecewise function 
        <me>
         f(x) = \left\{
          \begin{array}{ll}
           x-1, \qquad  x \lt  1 \\ \\
           x+1,   \qquad x \geq 1
          \end{array} \right. 
        </me>      
       Below is a data chart as in <xref ref="ex1xapp1" />.  Make sure you understand how the <m>f(x)-</m>values are calculated.
      </p>  

       <image source="ch-3/c5.png" width="100%">  
       </image>

      <p>
       The issue here is that as <m>x \longrightarrow 1</m> the <m>f(x)-</m>values do not approach one unique number.  For <m>x</m> near 1 
       (considering both sides of 1), the <m>f(x)-</m>values are separated by a distance of just over 2 units:
        <ul>
         <li> as <m>x \longrightarrow 1^- </m>, the data shows that <m>f(x) \longrightarrow 0</m> </li>
         <li>as <m>x \longrightarrow 1^+ </m>, the data shows that <m>f(x) \longrightarrow 2</m> </li>
        </ul>  
       Looking at the graph, we expect the two <em>pieces</em> of <m>f</m> to be separated along the vertical line <m>x=1</m>.
      </p> 
      <image source="ch-3/c6.png" width="100%">

     </example>

     <definition xml:id="limit">
      Let <m>c</m> be a fixed real number.  We say the <term>limit</term> of the function <m>f(x)</m> is the number <m>L</m> if all the 
      <m>f(x)-</m>values can be made arbitrarily close to the number <m>L</m> by making <m>x</m> sufficiently close to <m>c</m>.  We denote 
      this by writing
       <me>
         \lim_{x \rightarrow c}f(x) = L.
       </me> 
     </definition>

      <p>
       Recall that  <m>\left[ x \rightarrow c \right]</m> is the same as <m> \left[ x \rightarrow c^{-} \: \: \textbf{AND} \: \: x \rightarrow c^{+} \right]</m>.
       Sometimes it is convenient to look at limits in which <m>x</m> approaches <m>c</m> from only one direction.  
       These are called <term>one-sided limit</term> and are denoted
        <ul>
         <li> <m> \displaystyle \lim_{x \rightarrow c^-}f(x) </m> for the <em>left-sided limit</em> and </li>
         <li> <m> \displaystyle \lim_{x \rightarrow c^+}f(x) </m> for the  <em>right-sided limit</em>.  </li>
        </ul> 
      </p>

      <p>
       <alert> Facts </alert>:
        <ul>
          <li> Limits of functions do not always exist.  When they do, they are unique (in other words, a function cannot have more than one 
               limit as <m> x \longrightarrow c </m>). </li>
          <li> <m> \displaystyle \lim_{x \rightarrow c}f(x) = L</m> if and only if <m> \displaystyle \lim_{x \rightarrow c^-}f(x) = 
                   \displaystyle \lim_{x \rightarrow c^+}f(x) = L</m>. </li>
        </ul>           
      </p>

      <p>
       The second fact above is useful in determining the existence (or lack of existence) of limits for piecewise functions as in 
       <xref ref="ex3xapp1" /> above.  It says that the two-sided limit exists if and only if both one-sided limits exist and equal the 
       same number.  If a limit does not exist we write <m>\displaystyle \lim_{x \rightarrow c}f(x)</m> DNE.
      </p>

      <p>
       Returning to our examples we can express our findings as follows:
        <ul>
         <li> <m>\displaystyle \lim_{x \rightarrow 1}f(x) = 2 </m> (and recall <m>f(1) = 2</m>) (<xref ref="ex1xapp1" />) </li>
         <li> <m>\displaystyle \lim_{x \rightarrow 1}f(x) = 2</m> (and recall <m>f(1)</m> was UNDEFINED) (<xref ref="ex2xapp1" />) </li>
         <li> <m>\displaystyle \lim_{x \rightarrow 1}f(x)</m> DNE since <m>0 = \displaystyle \lim_{x \rightarrow 1^-}f(x) 
                  \neq \displaystyle \lim_{x \rightarrow 1^+}f(x) = 2</m> (and recall <m>f(1) = 2</m>)  (<xref ref="ex3xapp1" />) </li>
        </ul>
       For <xref ref="ex3xapp1" />, the two-sided limit DNE because even though the one-sided limits both exist, they do not equal the 
       same number. It also interesting to note that although  <m>\displaystyle \lim_{x \rightarrow 1}f(x)</m> DNE in this example, we can 
       still evaluate <m>f</m> at <m>x=1</m> to get <m>f(1) = 2</m>, while in <xref ref="ex2xapp1" /> <m>\displaystyle \lim_{x \rightarrow 1}f(x) = 2</m> 
       but <m>f(1)</m> was UNDEFINED.  This highlights the difference between taking a limit and function evaluation. The function in <xref ref="ex1xapp1" />
       (in which <m>\displaystyle \lim_{x \rightarrow 1}f(x) = f(1)</m>) has a very nice property which allow us to calculate 
       its limit using direct substitution.  
      </p>

      <p>
       Relying on numerical tables and graphs is a nice way to gain some insight as to whether a limit exists or not, and what that limit 
       may be.  A more dependable approach, however, is needed.  For most of our applications we will be interested in the case when we 
       can use direct substitution to obtain the limit;  either immediately or after some algebraic reduction of the problem.  
       The following properties of limits give us circumstances under which this is possible.

       Two important consequences of the above limit properties:
        <ol marker="(1)">
         <li> If <m>p(x)</m> is any polynomial (<xref ref="poly" />) and <m>c</m> is any real number then 
              <m>\displaystyle \lim_{x \rightarrow c} p(x) = p(c)</m> (direct substitution). </li>
         <li> If <m>r(x)</m> is the quotient of two polynomials and <m>c</m> is in its domain then

             Notice that direct substitution leads to division by 0, which is undefined.  This, as we know, does not mean the 
             limit DNE (we found this limit to be 2 - see <xref ref="ex2xapp1"/>).  To calculate this limit algebraically, we have to do 
             a little algebra first.  Recall our work from above in which we found           
              <me>

             so that

     <title>Average Rate Of Change</title> 
     
     <p>
      Much of applied calculus involves an investigation of how one quantity changes with respect to another.  There are two types of 
      rates of change we will consider:
        <ul>
          <li> <em> Average Rate of Change (AROC) </em> </li>  
          <li> <em> Instantaneous Rate of Change (IROC) </em> </li>           
        </ul>
     </p>
      
     <p>
       To distinguish between these concepts, consider how your position in a vehicle changes
       with respect to time traveled. Suppose you drove 130 miles in <m>t=2</m> hours 
       (say from 1 pm to 3 pm). Then you drove an average of 
       <m>\dfrac{130 \: \textrm{miles}}{2 \: \textrm{hours}} = 65 \: \dfrac{\textrm{mi}}{\textrm{hr}}</m>.  
       So, <m> 65 \: \dfrac{\textrm{mi}}{\textrm{hr}}</m> is the AROC of your position over the time interval <m>[0,2]</m>.  
       On the other hand, suppose you look at your speedometer at 2 pm (<m>t=1</m> hour into your trip) and it reads  
       <m>68 \: \dfrac{\textrm{mi}}{\textrm{hr}}</m>.  Then your IROC at <m>t=1</m> hour into your trip is 
       <m> 68 \: \dfrac{\textrm{mi}}{\textrm{hr}}</m>.  </p> 

     <example xml:id="aroc-advertising-money">
      Suppose <m>f(x)</m> represents the number of backpacks sold in thousands by ADTF Distributors when they spend <m>x</m> hundred dollars 
      on advertising, valid for <m>0 \leq x \leq 4.</m>  The graph of <m>f(x)</m> is given below.

      <ol marker="(a)">
       <li>
        How many backpacks did ADTF Distributors sell as a result of increasing spending on advertising from $100 to $400?
         <solution>
          For an increase of spending from $100 to $400 we look at what happens as <m>x</m> increases from 1 to 4.
          In this case we see that <m>f(x)</m> increases from 2 to 3.51.  Since 3.51 - 2 = 1.51 we find that ADTF Distributors sold an 
          additional 1,510 backpacks as a result of increasing the amount spent on advertising from $100 to $400.
         </solution>
       </li> 
        
       <li>
        As money spent on advertising increased from $100 to $400, what was the average number of backpacks sold per hundred dollar increase?
         <solution>
          We need to determine the average change in <m>f</m> as <m>x</m> increases from 1 to 2, then 2 to 3, and finally 3 to 4. Respectively,
          these changes are 3-2=1, 3.5-3 = .5, and 3.51 - 3.5 = .01. The average of these three numbers is 
           <me>
           \dfrac{1+.5+.01}{3} = \dfrac{1.51}{3} = .50\bar{3}
           </me>
          Alternatively, this is is the same as as finding <m> \dfrac{\Delta f}{\Delta x}</m> over the <m>x-</m>interval <m>[1,4]</m>
           <me>
            \dfrac{\Delta f}{\Delta x} = \dfrac{3.51 - 2}{4-1} = \dfrac{1.51}{3} = .50\bar{3}
           </me> 
          We conclude that as money spent on advertising increased from $100 to $400, ADTF Distributors' sales increased on average 
          by approximately 503 backpacks per hundred dollar increase spent on advertising. This number is average rate of change of 
          <m>f</m> as <m>x</m> goes from 1 to 4.  That is,

      Observe that the slope of the line <m>L</m> through the points <m>(1,2)</m> and <m>(4,3.51)</m> in <xref ref="aroc-advertising-money"/>
      is the same as the AROC of <m>f</m> over the <m>x-</m>interval <m>[1,4]</m>. A line that goes through two specified points on the graph 
      of a function, as <m>L</m> does, is called a <term>secant line</term>.  Note that every AROC is the slope of some secant 
      line (and vice versa).

      For future work with derivatives, let's change the labeling in the AROC formula.  Assume <m>x_1 \lt x_2</m> and that there are 
      <m>h</m> units of distance in between <m>x_1</m> and <m>x_2</m> (we are assuming <m>h \gt 0</m> here).  Let <m>x_1 = x</m> so that 
      <m>x_2 = x + h</m>. Then the AROC formula in the above definition becomes
        <me>
         \dfrac{f(x_2) - f(x_1)}{x_2 - x_1} = \dfrac{f(x +h) - f(x)}{(x+h) - x} = \dfrac{f(x +h) - f(x)}{h} 
       </me>
      The quantity on the right is another way to express the AROC of <m>f</m> and is also called the <term>difference quotient</term> of <m>f</m>.  
      As before, it still represents the slope of the secant line through <m>(x,f(x))</m> and <m>(x+h, f(x+h))</m>.  Below is a graph 
      illustrating both versions of the AROC formula and the corresponding secant line.

     <title>Instantaneous Rate Of Change and the Derivative</title> 

     <p>
      As mentioned before, the concept of <em>slope of a line</em> and <em>rate of change</em> are equivalent (<m>\Delta y</m> by <m>\Delta x</m>). 
      The <em>instantaneous rate of change</em> (IROC) of a function <m>f</m> at a fixed value <m>x</m> is the same as the slope of the 
      <em>tangent line</em> at the point <m>P=(x,f(x))</m>.  Let's call this line <m>T</m>. This line <m>T</m> ``touches" the graph of 
      <m>f</m> at the point <m>P</m> and has the same ``direction" as the graph at the point <m>P</m>.
     </p>

     <image source="ch-3/c11.png" width="100">  
     </image>
     
     <p>
      Notice how similar the graph of <m>f</m> and the graph of <m>T</m> are NEAR the point <m>P</m>.  Because they are so similar, 
      we can use the slope of <m>T</m> (which is the IROC of <m>f</m> at <m>x</m>) to approximate how <m>f</m> will increase or decrease as 
      <m>x</m> increases by one unit. :
     </p>

     <p>
      To find the slope of the tangent line <m>T</m> at the point <m>P= (x,f(x))</m>, let <m>L_1</m> be the secant line through the points 
      <m>(x,f(x))</m> and <m>(x+h,f(x+h))</m>.  Let's suppose <m>h > 0</m>.  Keep making <m>h</m> smaller and smaller and smaller and smaller 
      (that is, let <m>h \rightarrow 0</m>), and each time you pick a smaller value for <m>h</m>, draw another secant line through 
      <m>(x,f(x))</m> and <m>(x+h,f(x+h))</m>.  You will end up with infinitely many secant lines (one for each value of <m>h</m>) 
      that get closer and closer to having the slope of the tangent line.  Look at the picture below, where only three of these lines are drawn. 
      Starting at <m>L_1</m>, <m>h</m> was made smaller to get to <m>L_2</m>, and then smaller still to get to <m>L_3</m>.  Notice how 
      these lines approach the tangent line <m>T</m>.
     </p>

     <image source="ch-3/c12.png" width="80">  
     </image>

     <p>
      Each one of these secant lines has slope 
        <me>
          m_L = \dfrac{f(x+h) - f(x)}{h}
        </me>
      where <m>h</m> gets closer and closer and closer and closer (you get the idea) to 0.
      So, the slope of the tangent line, <m>m_T</m>, is found by taking a limit:
        <me>
          m_T = \lim_{h \rightarrow 0} \dfrac{f(x+h)-f(x)}{h}
        </me>
      Remember this is also the IROC of <m>f</m> at <m>x</m>.  That is, 
        <me>
          m_T = \lim_{h \rightarrow 0} \dfrac{f(x+h)-f(x)}{h} = \: \textrm{IROC of} \: f \: \textrm{at} \: x.

     </p>

     <definition xml:id="deriv-def">
      The <term>derivative</term> of the function <m>f(x)</m>, denoted as <m>f'(x)</m> or <m>\dfrac{df}{dx}</m>, is given by

         f'(x) = \dfrac{df}{dx} = \lim_{h  \rightarrow 0} \dfrac{f(x+h)-f(x)}{h}

      provided the limit exists.  If the limit does not exits, we say <m>f</m> is <term>non-differentiable</term> at <m>x</m>.

     <p>
     <em>A Comment About Notation:</em>
     </p>
     <p>
      Note that there are two forms of notation for the derivative: <m>f'(x)</m> (read ``<m>f</m> prime of <m>x</m>") is Sir Isaac Newton's notation 
      and <m>\dfrac{df}{dx}</m> (read ``d <m>f</m> d <m>x</m>";  this is NOT a fraction) is Gottfried Leibniz's notation.  They both represent the 
      derivative defined above. You should become familiar working with both.  We can also express the derivative as 
      <m>f'(x) = \dfrac{df}{dx} = \dfrac{d}{dx}(f(x))</m>.  For evaluation at <m>x=c</m>, we write <m>f'(c)</m> , or in case we're using Liebniz notation, 
      we write <m>\dfrac{df}{dx}\bigg|_{x=c}</m>.  The vertical bar is called an <em>evaluation bar</em>. 
     </p> 

     <p>
      Our biggest application of the derivative will be its use as an IROC.  In light of the discussion at the start of this section, 
      for a fixed value of <m>x_0</m> in the domain of <m>f</m>, <m>f'(x_0)</m> gvies us an approximation of how <m>f</m> changes as the 
      given <m>x</m>-value increases by one unit.  
     </p> 

     <example>
      Suppe <m>C(b)</m> represent's ADTF Distributors' cost (in dollars) for <m>b</m> bookends produced and sold by the company.  
      Interpret <m>C'(123) = \dfrac{dC}{db}\bigg|_{b=123}= -7.30</m>.
       <solution>
        Let's first assign units to this value.  Since <m>C</m> is cost given in dollars, and <m>b</m> is bookends produced and sold, the units for the 
        derivative are:  
         <me>
          C'(123) = -7.30 \: \dfrac{\textrm{dollars}}{\textrm{bookend}}.  
         </me>  
        Since the value of the derivative is negative, the interpretation is: 
        <p>
         When ADTF Distributors produces and sells <m>b=123</m> bookends, their cost is decreasing at a rate of <m>\$ 7.30</m> per additional 
         bookend produced and sold. In other words, <m>C'(123) = -7.30</m> tells us that <m>C</m> will decrease by approximately <m>\$7.30</m> 
         from production of the <m>124^{\textrm{th}}</m> bookend.  Notice that the derivative, <m>C'</m>, gives us information about the 
         original cost function, <m>C</m>.  
        </p> 
       </solution>

     <title>More About Marginal Analysis</title> 
     
      <p>
       Marginal analysis was introduced in <xref ref="linear-functions"/>. Recall that the marginal cost, 
       marginal revenue, and marginal profit functions are the (instantaneous) rates of change of the cost, revenue, and profit 
       functions respectively.  In other words, the marginal functions are the derivatives of their respective business functions, and approximate
       how these functions change as the input variable changes by one unit. If <m>C(x)</m>, <m>R(x)</m>, and <m>P(x)</m> are 
       the cost, revenue, and profit functions respectively, then their marginal functions are: 
      </p>

      <ul>
       <li> <m>MC(x) = C'(x)</m>  </li>
       <li> <m>MR(x) = R'(x)</m>  </li> 
       <li> <m>MP(x) = P'(x)</m>  </li>
      </ul>
      
      <p>
       To tie this into the our previous work with these functions, note that the derivative of a linear function is its slope. 
       Indeed, if <m>C(x) = mx + b</m> is a linear cost function, then

        <md>
         <mrow> MC(x) = C'(x) \amp = \lim_{h \rightarrow 0} \dfrac{C(x+h) - C(x)}{h}  =  \lim_{h \rightarrow 0} \dfrac{m(x+h) +b - (mx+b)}{h} </mrow>
         <mrow>  \amp = \lim_{h \rightarrow 0} \dfrac{mh}{h} = \lim_{h \rightarrow 0} m = m  </mrow>
        </md>
      In other words, if <m>C(x) = mx + b</m>, then <m>MC(x) = C'(x) = m</m>. See <xref ref="ex-dining-room-chairs" /> as an example
      illustraing this idea. In general, the marginal functions <m>MC(x)</m>, <m>MR(x)</m>, and <m>MP(x)</m> 
      approximate the change in cost, revenue, and profit as <m>x</m> increases by one unit.

      The following rule gives us a convenient method to find the derivative of a function under certain circumstances.

     <p>
     It's important to note that the Power Rule does not apply to functions such as <m>f(x) = 2^{x}</m>.  
     Functions such as this are called exponential functions (the variable is in the exponent) and require 
     different techniques to differentiate.  However, we can extend the <xref ref="thm-power-rule" /> to apply 
     to finite sums and differences of scalar multiples of power functions, <m>x^k</m>, using the following two 
     properties of the derivative. 
     </p>
     
     <p>
      <em>Properties of the Derivative:</em> Let <m>c</m> be a real number and suppose that both 
      <m>f</m> and <m>g</m> are differentiable.  Then... 
       <ul>
        <li>
         <m>\dfrac{d}{dx}(cf(x)) = c f'(x)</m>

         Let's first rewrite this function as <m>q(t) = -4t^{1/2} + \dfrac{2}{3}t^{-1/4} + 6</m>.  Now
          <me>
           \dfrac{dq}{dt} = -4\left(\dfrac{1}{2}t^{1/2 -1}\right) +\dfrac{2}{3}\left(-\dfrac{1}{4}t^{-1/4 - 1}\right) + 0

      units of the product.  Find and interpret the marginal revenue when 10,000 units of the product are produced.
       <solution>
        Let <m>R(x)</m> be the revenue function.  We are asked to find and interpret <m>MR(10,000)</m>. 
        First we need the revenue function.  Recall that 
         <me>
          R(x) = \textrm{(number of units)(price per unit)}
         </me>
        which means
         <me>
          R(x) = (x)\left(  \dfrac{50,000-x}{25,000} \right) = \dfrac{50,000x}{25,000} - \dfrac{x^2}{25,000} 
          = 2x -\dfrac{x^2}{25,000}
         </me> 
        so that after differentiating
         <me>
          MR(x) = 2 - \dfrac{x}{12,500}.
         </me> 
        Finally, <m>MR(10,000) = \$1.20 \: \dfrac{\textrm{dollars}}{\textrm{unit}} </m> which means: 
        When <m>x=10,000</m> units are produced, revenue is increasing at an approximate rate of $1.20 per additional 
        unit produced. In other words, the revenue generated from the 10,001<m>^{\textrm{st}}</m> unit is approximately 
        $1.20.

      Notice that input values that make the derivative, <m>f'</m> (or slope of the tangent line), 0 may correspond 
      to points where <m>f</m> may have a ``peak" or ``valley" on it's graph (see <xref ref="ex-horizontal-tan" />).  These points 
      correspond to what we call relative (or local) extreme values of <m>f</m>.  This is at the heart of optimization 
      applications and the topic of the this section.
     </p>

     <p>
      As we have learned, <m>f'</m> gives us the instantaneous rate of change of <m>f</m>.  Recall that when we interpret a 
      value of the derivative, we mention that <m>f</m> is increasing if <m>f'</m> is positive or that <m>f</m> is decreasing 
      if <m>f'</m> is negative.  This applies to the graph of <m>f</m> as well.

     <p>
     In general, it is not easy to algebraically determine on what intervals a function is increasing or decreasing. 
     Fortunately, we can use the sign of the derivative to make this job much simpler.
     </p>

     <fact xml:id="fact-inc-dec"> 
       <statement> Let <m>I</m> represent an open interval.  Then
        <ul>
         <li> <m>f(x)</m> is increasing on <m>I</m> if and only if <m>f'(x) &gt; 0</m> for <m>x</m> in <m>I</m> </li>
         <li> <m>f(x)</m> is decreasing on <m>I</m> if and only if <m>f'(x) &lt; 0</m> for <m>x</m> in <m>I</m> </li>
        </ul>
       </statement> 
     </fact>

     <p> 
      If we combine these facts with what we observed in <xref ref="ex-horizontal-tan" />, we have a method to 
      find the ``peaks" and ``valleys" on the graph of a differentiable function (without having the 
      graph available).  The graph below indicates how we can use the sign of the derivative, along 
      with the places where the derivative is equal to 0, to find these ``peaks" and ``valleys." 
     </p>

      <image source="ch-3/c17a.png" width="80">

     <p>
      In general, if we know <m>f'(c_1) = 0</m>, and the sign of the derivative changes from negative to positive in some 
      small neighborhood containing <m>c_1</m>, then <m>(c_1, f(c_1))</m> will be a ``valley" on the graph 
      of <m>f</m> (<em>this is because these sign changes of the derivative tell us that <m>f</m> changes from 
      decreasing to increasing, and so must ``bottom out" at <m>c_1</m></em>).  In this case we call <m>f(c_1)</m> a 
      relative (or local) minimum value of <m>f</m>.  ``Relative" because, as you can see in the above picture, 
      <m>f(c_1)</m> is NOT the smallest function value.  It is the smallest, however, relative to the <m>f(x)</m>-values 
      for <m>x</m> near <m>c_1</m>. Similarly if we know <m>f'(c_2) = 0</m>, and the sign of the derivative changes from positive 
      to negative (<em> which means <m>f</m> goes from increasing to decreasing, so must ``max out" </em>) in some small 
      neighborhood containing <m>c_2</m>, then <m>(c_2, f(c_2))</m> will be a ``peak" on the graph of <m>f</m>.  
      In this case we call <m>f(c_2)</m> a relative (or local) maximum value of <m>f</m>. Below is a more formal definition 
      of these concepts.
     </p>

     <definition xml:id="def-rel-ext"> Suppose <m>f(x)</m> is a function with the value <m>c</m> in its domain.  Then <m>f(x)</m> has a 
     <term>relative (or local) maximum</term> value of <m>f(c)</m> at <m>x=c</m> if <m>f(c) \geq f(x)</m> for every <m>x</m> near <m>c</m>.  
     Similarly, <m>f(x)</m> has a <term>relative (or local) minimum</term> value of <m>f(c)</m> at <m>x=c</m> if <m>f(c) \leq f(x)</m> for 
     every <m>x</m> near <m>c</m>.
     </definition>

     <p> 
      In the above definition, ``for every <m>x</m> near <m>c</m>" actually means ``for every <m>x</m> in some open interval containing <m>c</m>."
     </p> 

     <p>
      We have a similar situation to the one in the above picture if the graph of <m>f</m> comes to a sharp point at <m>c_1</m> and <m>c_2</m>. 
      The difference is that the derivative is not 0 at <m>c_1</m> and <m>c_2</m> in this case, but does not exist at these values instead.  
      In other words, <m>f</m> is non-differentiable at <m>c_1</m> and <m>c_2</m>. The reason is because <m>f</m> does not have a unique tangent 
      line (or unique direction) at these points. This scenario is not as important as the one above for our applications of the derivative, 
      but you should be aware of difference.  See the picture below for an illustration.
     </p>
    
     <image source="ch-3/c18.png" width="80">

     <p>
      Notice that in the 2 graphs above, and <xref ref="ex-horizontal-tan" />, the relative extreme values occurred in places where the derivative 
      was 0 (that is, where there was a horizontal tangent line), or where the derivative was undefined (no unique tangent line). 
      These values have a special name.

     <definition xml:id="def-crit-numb">

      The following fact greatly simplifies our work finding relative extreme values of a function.

      </statement>
     </fact>

     <p>
      In light of the above fact, if we want to find relative extreme values of function, the only places we need look are at the critical numbers. 
      This is good news, because most functions we work with will not have more than a few critical numbers.  
     </p>

     <p>
      The above fact, however, DOES NOT say that every critical number will produce a relative extreme value.  Consider, for example, <m>f(x) = x^3</m>.  
      Then <m>f'(x) = 3x^2</m> so that <m>f'(0) = 0</m> and we see that <m>x=0</m> is a critical number of <m>f</m>.  Notice that if <m>x \neq 0</m>,  <m>f'(x) = 3x^2</m> is 
      greater than 0, which means that <m>f</m> is always increasing, so does not ``max out" at <m>(0,f(0))</m>, but just has a flat spot (for a horizontal tangent) instead.

     <p>
      Finding relative extreme values for a function using a sign chart for its derivative is what we will refer to as using 
      <term>the first derivative test</term>.
     </p>

     <example>
      Let <m>f(x) = \dfrac{1}{4}x^4 - \dfrac{4}{3}x^3 +2x^2 + 1</m>.  Find intervals where <m>f</m> is increasing, decreasing, 
      and find all relative extreme values of <m>f</m>.
       <solution>
        We will use the first derivative test by making a sign chart for <m>f'(x)</m>.  First we need the critical numbers of <m>f</m>.  These numbers must be 
        in the domain of <m>f</m>, so first note that dom(<m>f</m>) <m>= (-\infty, \infty)</m>.  Next, we solve <m>f'(x) = 0</m>. 
        Note that <m>f'(x) = x^3 - 4x^2+4x</m>.  So,
         <md>
          <mrow> f'(x) \amp = 0 </mrow>
          <mrow> x^3 - 4x^2+4x \amp =0 </mrow>
          <mrow> x(x^2 -4x +4) \amp = 0 </mrow>
          <mrow> x(x-2)^2  \amp = 0 </mrow>
         </md>
        We find two critical numbers: <m>x=0</m> and <m>x=2</m>. We can algebraically check the sign of the derivative, <m>f'</m>, by picking test values 
        in the appropriate intervals determined by the critical numbers: 
         <ul>
          <li> In the interval <m>(-\infty, 0)</m> we can test with <m>x = -1</m>:  
           <me>
            f'(-1) = (-1)(-1-2)^2 &lt; 0
           </me>
          </li>

          <li> In the interval <m>(0,2)</m> we can test with <m>x = 1</m>:
           <me>
            f'(1) = (1)(1-2)^2 &gt; 0
           </me>
          </li>
         
         <li> In the interval <m>(2, \infty)</m> we can test with <m>x = 3</m>:
           <me>
            f'(3) = (3)(3-2)^2 &gt; 0
           </me>
          </li>
         </ul>
        The signs of the derivative, <m>f'</m>, tell us whether the function <m>f</m> is increasing or decreasing, which we will indicate with up and down arrows respectively. 
        The sign chart for <m>f'</m> is below.
        
        <image source="ch-3/c24.png" width="80">  
        </image>
        
        Using our sign chart, we can now answer the questions.
        <ul>
         <li>
          <m>f(x)</m> is increasing on the intervals <m>(0, 2)</m> and <m>(2,\infty)</m>. 
         </li>

         <li>
          <m>f(x)</m> is decreasing on the interval <m>(-\infty, 0)</m>.  
         </li>

         <li>
          <m>f(x)</m> has no relative maximum value.
         </li>
         
         <li>
          <m>f(x)</m> has a relative minimum at <m>x=0</m>.  The relative minimum value is <m>f(0) = 1</m>.  
         </li>
        </ul>
        Notice that even though there is no relative extreme value at <m>x=2</m>, there is a "flat spot" there where <m>f</m> has a horizontal tangent line. 
        Following is the graph of <m>f(x) = \dfrac{1}{4}x^4 - \dfrac{4}{3}x^3 +2x^2 + 1</m>

           <md>
            <mrow> \overline{C}(x) \amp = \frac{C(x)}{x} </mrow>
            <mrow>     </mrow>
            <mrow> \overline{C}(x) \amp = \frac{32,400 + 800x+x^2}{x} </mrow>
            <mrow>     </mrow>
            <mrow>   \overline{C}(x) \amp = 32,400x^{-1} + 800 + x  </mrow>
           </md>
          Since <m>MC(x) = C'(x)</m>, the marginal cost function is 
           <me>
            MC(x) = 800 + 2x.
           </me>  
         </solution>
       </li>

       <li>
        Find and interpret the average cost and marginal cost when 2,000 iOONs are produced.
        <solution>
         Let's first calculate the average cost. 
          <md>
            <mrow> \overline{C}(2,000) \amp = \frac{C(2,000)}{2000} </mrow>
            <mrow> </mrow>
            <mrow> \overline{C}(2,000) \amp = \frac{5,632,400}{2,000} </mrow>
            <mrow> </mrow>
            <mrow> \overline{C}(2,000) \amp = 2,816.2 </mrow>
          </md>
         Hence, the average cost when ADTF Distributors produces 2,000 iOONs is $2,816.2 per iOON. To find the margincal 
         cost we evaluate the derivative of the cost function at <m>x=2,000</m>.  
          <md>
            <mrow> MC(2,000) \amp = 800 + 2(2,000) </mrow>
            <mrow> MC(2,000) \amp = 4,800 </mrow>.
          </md>
         This means that when <m>x=2,000</m> iOONs are produced, ADTF Distributors' costs are increasing at an approximate rate
         of $4,800 per additioanl iOON. That is, the cost of the 2,001<m>^\textrm{st}</m> iOON is approximately $4,800 
         more than the 2,000<m>^\textrm{th}</m> iOON.
        </solution>
       </li> 

       <li>
        Use the first derivate test to minimize ADTF Distributors' average cost.
         <solution>
          We start by finding the critical values for <m>\overline{C}(x)</m>. To do this we must solve 
          <m>\overline{C}'(x) = 0</m>. First observe that 
          <me>
           \overline{C}'(x) = 1 -32,400x^{-2} = \dfrac{x^2-32,400}{x^2}
          </me>. 
          So,
           <md>
            <mrow> \overline{C}'(x) \amp = 0 </mrow>
            <mrow> </mrow>
            <mrow> \frac{x^2-32,400}{x^2} \amp = 0 </mrow>
            <mrow> </mrow>
            <mrow> x^2 - 32,400 \amp = 0 </mrow>
            <mrow> </mrow>
            <mrow> (x-180)(x+180) \amp = 0 </mrow>
           </md> 
          Since dom(<m>\overline{C}(x)</m>)<m>= (0, \infty)</m>, the only cirtical number we find is <m>x=180</m>. Now
          we make a sign chart for <m>\overline{C}'(x)</m> to confirm that <m>x=180</m> minimizes average cost.
           <ul>
            <li> In the interval <m>(0, 180)</m> we can test with <m>x = 1</m>:  
             <me>
              \overline{C}'(1) = \frac{(1-180)(1+180)}{1^2} &lt; 0
             </me>
            </li>

           <li> In the interval <m>(180, \infty)</m> we can test with <m>x = 181</m>:  
             <me>
              \overline{C}'(181) = \frac{(181-180)(181+180)}{180^2} &gt; 0
             </me>
           </li>
          </ul>
        
        The sign chart for <m>\overline{C}'(x)</m> is below.
         <image source="ch-3/c28.png" width="50">  
         </image>
        From our sign chart we conclude
         <ul>
            <li>
             ADTF Distributors' avaerage cost decreased on the interval <m>(0,180)</m>.
            </li> 

            <li>
             ADTF Distributors' avaerage cost increased on the interval <m>(180,\infty)</m>.
            </li> 

            <li>
              ADTF Distributors has a relative minimum average cost when they produce <m>x=180</m> iOONs. Their minimum average cost
              is <m>\overline{C}(180) = 1,160 </m> (dollars per iOON) per iOON.
             </li>

      <title> The Second Derivative </title>

     <p>
     If a function <m>f</m> has a first derivative, <m>f'</m>, then we may ask if <m>f'</m> is differentiable.  If so, we call the 
     derivative of <m>f'</m> the <term>second derivative</term> of <m>f</m> and denote it by <m>f''</m> or <m>\dfrac{d^2f}{dx^2}</m>. 
     Of course, we can continue to check the differentiability of successive derivatives.  These successive derivatives are 
     called <term>higher order derivatives</term> of <m>f</m>.  The notation for these higher order derivatives is given below. 
     Notice that beyond order three, the "prime" notation changes and the order of the derivative is indicated by the number in 
     parenthesis.
      <ul>
       <li>
         First derivative: <m>f'(x) = \dfrac{df}{dx}</m>
       </li>

       <li>
        Second derivative: <m>f''(x) = \dfrac{d^2f}{dx^2}</m>
       </li>

       <li>
        Third Derivative: <m>f'''(x) = \dfrac{d^3f}{dx^3}</m>
       </li>

       <li>
        Fourth Derivative: <m>f^{(4)}(x) = \dfrac{d^4f}{dx^4}</m>
       </li>

       <li>
        Fifth Derivative: <m>f^{(5)}(x) = \dfrac{d^5f}{dx^5}</m>
       </li>
      </ul>
     </p>
      
     <example>
      Find all derivatives of <m>f(x) = 8x^3 - 9x^2 +6x + 4</m>.
       <solution>
       For each derivative, we can use the power rule:
        <ul>
         <li>
          <m> f'(x)  = \dfrac{df}{dx}  = 24x^2 - 18x + 6  </m>
         </li>

        <li>
         <m> f''(x)  = \dfrac{d^2f}{dx^2}  = 48x - 18 </m>
        </li>

        <li>
         <m> f'''(x) = \dfrac{d^3f}{dx^3} = 48</m>
        </li>

        <li>
         <m>f^{(4)}(x)  = \dfrac{d^4f}{dx^4} = 0</m>
        </li>
       </ul>
       Each successive derivative will also be 0.  That is, 
        <me>
         f^{(n)}(x) = \dfrac{d^nf}{dx^n} = 0
        </me>
       for all <m>n \geq 4</m>. 
       </solution>
     </example>

     <p>
      One application of the second derivative is that <m>f''(x)</m> will give the instantaneous rate of change of <m>f'</m>. This has
      geometric consequences. <term>Concavity</term> is related to the rate of change of a function's derivative which can be found by  
      looking at the sign of the second derivative. A function <m>f</m> is <term>concave up</term> where the first derivative, <m>f'</m>, 
      is increasing (that is, where <m>f'' &gt; 0</m>), and <term>concave down</term> where the first derivative, <m>f'</m>, is decreasing 
      (that is, where <m>f'' &lt; 0</m>).  A point where concavity changes is called an <term>inflection point</term>.  
      Geometrically, a function is concave up on intervals where the graph "bends up", or is above its tangent lines.  
      The function is concave down on intervals where the graph "bends down", or is below its tangent lines.

     <p>
      Notice that in the picture on the left, the slopes of tangent lines get larger from left to right. In other words, the deriviate
      increases, which means the second derivative is positive.   
      In the picture on the right, the slopes of tangent lines get smaller from left to right. In other words, the deriviate 
      decreases, which means the second derivative is negative. Again, an inflection point is a point where concavity changes. That is,
      a point about which <m>f''</m> changes sign.

     <fact> xref ref="inflection-point">
      <statement>
       If <m>x=c</m> corresponds to an inflection point for the function <m>f</m>, then either <m>f''(c) = 0</m> or 
       <m>f''</m> is NOT DEFINED at <m>x=c</m>.
      </statement>
     </fact>

     <p>
      We can use a <em>sign chart for the second derivative</em> to find inflection points in a similar way that we used a 
      sign chart for the first derivative to find relative extreme values.  We find places where the second derivative is zero, 
      put that value on a number line, and check the sign of the second derivative on either side.  If the sign changes 
      (that is, if concavity changes) from one side to the other, then we have an inflection point.
     </p>

     <p>
      This information is summarized in the <term>Concavity Test</term>: Suppose <m>f</m> is such that <m>f'</m> and <m>f''</m> exist for 
      all <m>x</m> in the interval <m>(a,b)</m>.  
        <ul>
         <li>
          If <m>f''(x) &gt; 0</m> on <m>(a,b)</m>, then <m>f</m> is concave up on <m>(a,b)</m>. 
         </li>

        <li>
         If <m>f''(x) &lt; 0</m> on <m>(a,b)</m>, then <m>f</m> is concave down on <m>(a,b)</m>
        </li>       
       </ul>
      Furthermore, if <m>x=c</m> is an inflection point of <m>f</m>, then either <m>f''(c)=0</m> or <m>f''(c)</m> does not exist. 
     </p>

     <p>
      Concavity and inflection points are related to the  <term>law of diminishing returns</term> in economics. 
      This law states that in all productive processes, adding more of one factor of production will at some point yield 
      lower incremental per-unit returns. A <term>point of diminishing returns</term> refers to a point at which the optimal level
      of capacity is reached, where incremental increases in the input result in smaller increases in output. Mathematically, a point of
      diminishing returns is an inflection point through which the function increases and its derivative changes from increasing to 
      decreasing (or equivalently, where the second derivative changes from  positive to negative).

          <solution>
           Since <m>P</m> is valid for <m>2 \leq t \leq 10</m>, in interval notation this is expressed as dom(<m>P</m>)<m>= [2,10]</m>.

         Find any inflection ponts for <m>P(t)</m> by making and interpreting a sign chart for <m>P''(t)</m>. If you do find an

           and we see that <m>t=6</m> may give an inflection point. Let's make a sign chart for the second derivative.
            <ul>
              <li> In the interval <m>[2, 6)</m> we can test with <m>t = 3</m>:

            Since the sign of <m>P''</m> changes about <m>t=6</m>, we can conclude that the point <m>(6,P(6)) = (6,19.6)</m>
            is an inflection point. Comparing the sign charts for <m>P'</m> and <m>P''</m> we see that

              <m>P</m> is deceasing at an increasing rate from <m>t=2</m> to <m>t=3</m>

               <m>P</m> is decreasing at a decreasing rate from <m>t=9</m> to <m>t=10</m>
              </li>
             </ul>
            From the second and third bullet points above, we can now conclude that (6,19.6) is a point of diminishing returns.
            That is, Pendant Publusihng had a point of diminishing returns in 2004 during which year their profit was $19,600,000.

      The second derivative can also be used to help us identify relative extreme values of function. This process is called the 
      <term>The Second Derivative Test</term> and will be our primary application of the second derivative.

     <p> 
      Suppose <m>x=c</m> is a critical number of the function <m>f</m> and <m>c</m> is in the domain of <m>f''</m>.  Then we can use the second 
      derivative to determine if <m>f(c)</m> is a relative maximum or a relative minimum value of <m>f</m> as follows:
       <ul>
        <li>
         If <m>f''(c) &lt; 0</m> then <m>f(c)</m> is a relative maximum value of <m>f</m>.
        </li>

        <li>
          If <m>f''(c) &gt; 0</m> then <m>f(c)</m> is a relative minimum value of <m>f</m>.
        </li>
       </ul>
      If <m>f''(c) = 0</m> then no conclusion can be made.  In this case, you need to use the first derivative test to determine 
      if <m>f(c)</m> is a relative extreme value.

     <example>
      WKRP in Cincinnati is a radio station with annual listernship predicted by the model

        L(t) = \dfrac{1}{3}t^3 -10t^2 + 91t-165
        </me> 
      in millions of listeners, where <m>t</m> the number of years since 2008. Use the second derivative test to determine the relative
      extreme values for <m>L(t)</m> and when they occurred. Write sentences to interpret your answers. Round function 
      values to two decimal places.
       <solution>
        We begin by finding the critical numbers for <m>L(t)</m>. We solve

      <title> Absolute Extrema </title>

      <p>
       In most optimization problems, one is interested in finding the <em>absolute</em>, as opposed to <em>relative</em>, extreme 
       values of a function. So now we will be looking for more than "peaks" and "valleys" on the graph of function.  What we want
       to determine is the absolute largest and absolute smallest output values of a function, if they exist.
      </p> 
      
      <definition>
       Let <m>f(x)</m> be a function with <m>c</m> in its domain. Then <m>f(c)</m> is the <term>absolute maximum</term> value of 
       <m>f</m> if <m>f(c) \geq f(x)</m> for every <m>x</m> in the domain of <m>f</m>.  Similarly, <m>f(c)</m> is the 
       <term>absolute minimum</term> value of <m>f</m> if <m>f(c) \leq f(x)</m> for every <m>x</m> in the domain of <m>f</m>.
      </definition>

      <p>
       See the graph below for a comparison of relative and absolute extreme values of <m>f</m>.
      </p>

      <image source="ch-3/c34.png" width="65">  
      </image>

      <p>
       Notice that <m>f</m> in the above graph does indeed have a largest (<m>f(a)</m>) and smallest (<m>f(c_1)</m>) output value. 
       It is those values we are interested in finding.  Observe that the absolute maximum occurred at an endpoint 
       of the graph, and not a "peak," so to speak.  In other words, we have an absolute maximum value of <m>f</m> that 
       is NOT a relative maximum value of <m>f</m> (relative extreme values cannot occur at endpoints).  On the other hand, 
       <m>f(c_1)</m> is both an absolute and relative minimum.  Notice that in this case, the absolute minimum value of <m>f</m> 
       occurred at a critical number inside the interval <m>[a,b]</m>.
      </p>

      <p>
       Not every function will have an absolute maximum and/or absolute minimum value (for instance, think of <m>f(x) = x^3</m> 
       on the entire real line).  The following theorem tells us when we can be certain these absolute extreme values exist.
      </p>

      <theorem xml:id="evt">
        <title> Extreme Value Theorem </title>
        <statement>
          A continuous function on a closed, bounded interval will have an absolute maximum value and an absolute minimum 
          value on that interval.
        </statement>
      </theorem>

      <p>
       In <xref ref="evt"/> "continuous function" means that the function has no jumps or holes in its graph. All 
       polynomials are continuous everywhere.  "Closed, bounded interval" means the interval contains its endpoints 
       and both endpoints are finite values.  In other words, intervals of the form <m>[a,b]</m>, where 
       <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> are both real numbers, <m>a &lt; b</m>.  The above theorem tells us that every polynomial 
       will have absolute extreme values on every closed and bounded interval.
      </p>

      <p>
       Below are some pictures illustrating why it is necessary that <m>f</m> be continuous and the interval be closed 
       and bounded for <m>f</m> to be guaranteed to have absolute extreme values.

      <p>
       The Extreme Value Theorem tells us when we can expect a function to have absolute extreme values. 
       Below are a couple useful results that will help us find them.
      </p>

      <fact xml:id="fact-abs-ext">
       <statement>
        If <m>f</m> is continuous on <m>[a,b]</m> and <m>f(c)</m> is an absolute extreme value, then <m>c=a</m>, <m>c=b</m>, 
        or <m>c</m> is a critical number between <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> (see the first graph above).
       </statement> 
      </fact>  

      <p>
       This fact tells us that under the assumptions of <xref ref="evt" />, the absolute extreme values can only occur at 
       critical numbers or endpoints of intervals. 
      </p>

      <theorem xml:id="crit-number-thm">
        <title> Critical Number Theorem </title>
        <statement>
           Let <m>I</m> be ANY interval and suppose <m>f</m> has exactly one critical number in <m>I</m>. 
            <ul>
             <li>
              If <m>f(c)</m> is a relative maximum, then <m>f(c)</m> is an absolute maximum.

             <li>
              If <m>f(c)</m> is a relative minimum, then <m>f(c)</m> is an absolute minimum. 
             </li>
            </ul>
        </statement>
      </theorem>

      <example>
       Find the absolute extreme values of <m>f(x) = 3x^2 -12x +5</m> on <m>[0,3]</m>.
        <solution>
         <m>f</m> is a polynomial defined on the closed bounded interval <m>[0,3]</m>, so must have absolute 
         extreme values by <xref ref="evt" />.  To find them, we first get the critical numbers of <m>f</m>.  
         Since <m>f'(x) = 6x -12</m>,
          <md>
           <mrow> f'(x) \amp = 0 </mrow>
           <mrow> 6x - 12 \amp = 0 </mrow>
          </md>
         which gives <m>x=2</m> as the only critical value.  By <xref ref="fact-abs-ext" />, all we need to do to find the 
         absolute extreme values is evaluate <m>f</m> at the critical number, the endpoints of the interval, and compare: 
          <ul>
           <li>
            <m>f(0) = 3(0)^2 -12(0) + 5 =5</m>
           </li>

           <li>
            <m>f(2) = 3(2)^2 -12(2) + 5= -7</m>
           </li>

           <li>
            <m> f(3) = 3(3)^2 -12(3) + 5= -7= -4 </m>
           </li>
          </ul>
         So, <m>f(0) = 5</m> is the absolute maximum and <m>f(2) = -7</m> is the absolute minimum.  Below is the graph.

       VL Consultants is a national organization that contracts with colleges and universities around the US to help 
       them develop open educational resources for specialty courses.  Their annual revenue in hundreds of thousands 
       of dollars between the years 2015 and 2023 is given by the model 
        <me>
         R(t) = \dfrac{1}{4}t^4 -\dfrac{14}{3}t^3 +24t^2 + 25

          Write the domain of <m>R(t)</m> using interval notation.
           <solution>
            Since the model is valid between the years 2015 and 2023 and <m>t=0</m> corresponds to the year 2013,
            dom(<m>R</m>)<m> = [2,10] </m>

          Find and interpret VL Consultants' marginal revenue in 2017.
           <solution>
            Since 2017  corresponds to <m>t=4</m>, we need to find and interpret <m>MR(4)</m>.
            Taking the derivative of <m>R(t)</m>, the marginal revenue function is 
             <me>
              MR(t) = t^3-14t^2+48t.
             </me>
            Evaluating, we have <m>MR(4) = 32</m>, which means that in 2017, VL Consultants' revenue was increasing at an 
            approximate rate of $3,200,000 per year. That is, VL Consultants expects to genreate an additional $3,200,000 in

            which has three solutions, <m>t = 0, 6, 8</m>. Since <m>t=0</m> is not in the domain (see part (a)), we find 
            two critical numbers: <m>t = 6, 8</m> which correspond the years 2019 and 2021 respectively.

          Find the and interpret the relative extreme values of <m>R(t)</m>.
           <solution>
            We use the second derivative test: 
             <md>
              <mrow> MR(t) \amp = t^3-14t^2+48t </mrow>
              <mrow> R''(t) \amp = 3t^2 -28t + 48 </mrow>

              <li>
               <m>R''(6) = -12 &lt; 0 </m> which means <m>t=6</m> gives a relative maximum value for <m>R(t)</m>.

               <li>
               <m>R''(8) = 16 &gt; 0</m> which means <m>t=8</m> gives a relative minimum value for <m>R(t)</m>.
              </li>
             </ul>
            Since  <m>R(6)= 205</m> and <m>R(8)= 195.67 </m> we see that

            First observe that <m>R(t)</m> is a continuous function (it's a polynomial) defined on the closed and bounded 
            interval <m>[2,10]</m>. So, by <xref ref="evt" /> <m>R(t)</m> must achieve its absolute extreme values.
            To find them, we use  <xref ref="fact-abs-ext" />. That is, we evaluate <m>R(t)</m> at the critical numbers 
            (which was done in the previous part) and endpoints of the interval. 
             <ul>
               <li>

               </li>
              </ul>
            Comparing these values, we see that <m>R(t)</m> has an absolute minimum value of 87.67 at <m>t=2</m> and 
            an absolute maximum value of 258.33 at <m>t=10</m>. In the context of this model, this means

         Finally, we determine that absolute maximum value of <m>P(d)</m> on the interval <m>[0,300]</m>. As usual, 
         we need the critical value of <m>P(d)</m>. We solve

           <mrow> -2d + 242 \amp = 0</mrow>
          </md> 
         so that <m>d=121</m> is the only critical number of <m>P(d)</m>. Since <m>P''(121) = -2 &lt; 0</m>, the 
         second derivative test tells us that <m>d=121</m> gives a relative maximum. Since <m>d=121</m> is the only 
         critical number in <m>[0,300]</m>, <xref ref="crit-number-thm" /> tells us that the relative maximum will also 
         be an absolute maximum. Evaluating at <m>d=121</m>, we find <m>p(121) = 201</m> and <m>P(121) = 32,041</m>. Hence
         Fawlty Towers should charge $201 for a room to obtain a maximum profit of $32,041.

         C(x) = .001x^3 +3x +100,
        </me>
       and no more than 60,000 earbuds can be produced in a year.  How many sets of wireless earbuds should 
       ADTF Distributors manufacture in order to minimize their average cost per set?  What is the minimum average cost? 
        <solution>
         Let's first find the average cost function, <m>\overline{C}(x)</m>:
           <md>
            <mrow> \overline{C}(x) \amp = \dfrac{C(x)}{x} </mrow>

            <mrow> \overline{C}(x) \amp = .001x^2 +3 + 100x^{-1} </mrow>
           </md>
         We are asked to minimize <m>\overline{C}(x)</m> on the interval <m>(0,60]</m> (why is this the relevant interval?). 
         We start by finding the critical numbers.  Since
           <me>
            \overline{C}'(x) = .002x - 100x^{-2},
          </me>
         we solve the following equation for <m>x</m>: 
          <md>
            <mrow> .002x - 100x^{-2} \amp = 0 </mrow>
            <mrow> </mrow>
            <mrow> .002x - \dfrac{100}{x^{2}} \amp = 0 </mrow>
            <mrow> </mrow>
            <mrow> .002x \amp = \dfrac{100}{x^{2}} </mrow>
            <mrow> </mrow>
            <mrow> .002x^3 \amp = 100 </mrow>
            <mrow> </mrow>
            <mrow> x^3 \amp = 50,000 </mrow>
            <mrow> </mrow>
            <mrow> x \amp =  \sqrt[3]{50,000}  </mrow>
            <mrow> </mrow>
            <mrow> x \amp \approx 36.84  </mrow>
           </md> 
          Next we use the second derivative test to determine if <m>x=36.84</m> produces a relative minimum
          value for <m>\overline{C}(x)</m>. Since 
           <me>
            \overline{C}''(x) = .002+200x^{-3} = .002 + \dfrac{200}{x^3}
           </me>
          we find that <m>\overline{C}''(36.84) = .002 + \dfrac{200}{36.84^3} &gt; 0 </m> 
          which means <m>x = 36.84</m> gives a relative minimum value for <m>\overline{C}(x)</m>. Since 
          <m>x = 36.84</m> is the only critical number in <m>(0,60]</m>, <xref ref="crit-number-thm" /> tells 
          us that the relative minimum will also be an absolute minimum. This means ADTF Distraibutors
          should produce 36,840 sets of wireless earbuds to minimize the average cost per set.  Their 
          minimum annual average cost is $7,072 per thousand sets of wireless earbuds (or $7.07 per set).

      <p>
       Now we want to, in a sense, reverse the process of differentiation. In other words, given a function <m>f(x)</m>, 
       we want to find another function <m>g(x)</m> such that <m>g'(x) = f(x)</m>.  In this case, <m>g(x)</m> is called an 
       <term>antiderivative</term> of <m>f(x)</m>.  Observe that if <m>g(x)</m> is an antiderivative of <m>f(x)</m>, then so is 
       <m>g(x) + c</m> for every constant <m>c</m>.  Indeed:  <m>\dfrac{d}{dx}\left(g(x) + c \right) = g'(x) + 0 = g'(x) = f(x)</m>.
      </p>

      <p>
       For example, if <m>f(x) = 2x</m> then <m>g(x) = x^2</m> is an antiderivative of <m>f(x)</m> since <m>g'(x) = 2x = f(x)</m>. 
       Notice that <m>x^2 + 1</m>, <m>x^2 - 6</m>, <m>x^2 + \dfrac{2}{3}</m> are also antiderivatives of <m>f(x) = 2x</m>. 
       So, the most general antiderivative of <m>f(x) = 2x</m> is <m>g(x) = x^2 + c</m> where <m>c</m> is an arbitrary constant.
      </p>
      
      <p>
       The <term>indefinite integral</term> (which looks like this:  <m>\int</m>) is the notation used for antiderivatives. 
       Let <m></m> be an arbitrary constant.  Then   
        <me>
         \int f(x) \: dx = g(x) + c
        </me> 
       is read "the antiderivative (or integral) of  <m>f(x)</m> equals <m>g(x) + c</m>" and it means <m>g'(x) = f(x)</m>. The <m>dx</m> 
       will indicate the variable we are integrating with respect to (<m>x</m> in this case). The process of finding antiderivatives 
       may be referred to as <term>integration</term> and <m>f(x)</m> is called the <term>integrand</term>. We can now express 
       our above example as follows:     
      </p>
       <me>
        \int 2x \: dx = x^2 + c.

      <example>
       Sanalac is a progressive company with a small but prestigious group of clients. 
       The annual marginal profit from the sale of their rest stop supplies is given by 
        <me>
         MP(t) = -.75t^2 +12t + 55
        </me>  
       hundred dollars per year, where <m>t = 0</m> corresponds to the year 2001. Find Sanalac's 
       profit function given that their profit in 2011 was $78,300. Use your answer to determine Sanalac's 
       revenue in 2001 if their costs for that year were $15,000. 
        <solution>
         We are given 
          <ul>
           <li> 
            <m> MP(t) = P'(t) = -.75t^2 +12t + 55 </m>

           <li> 
            <m> P(10) = 783</m> (<m>t=10</m> corresonds to 2011 and <m>P</m> is in hundreds of dollars)
           </li>
          </ul>
         So, up to an arbitrary constant <m>c</m> (which we will have to determine),
          <me>
            P(t) = \int MP(t) \: dt = \int (-.75t^2 +12t + 55)  \: dt = -.25t^3 + 6t^2 +55t + c
          </me> 
         To find <m>c</m>, we have 
          <md>
            <mrow> P(10) \amp = -.25(10^3) + 6(10^2) + 55(10) + c </mrow>
            <mrow>       \amp = -250 + 600 + 550  + c </mrow>
            <mrow>       \amp=  900 + c </mrow>
          </md>
         Using the given info (see second bullet point above),
          <me>
           900 + c = 783
          </me> 
         so that <m>c = -117</m> and we see that Sanalac's annual profit function in hundreds of dollars is
          <me>
           P(t) = .25t^3 + 6t^2 + 55t - 117.
          </me>
         Notice that in 2001 Sanalac experienced a loss of $11,700 (<m>P(0) = -117</m>). Let <m>C(t)</m> 
         and <m>R(t)</m> represent Sanalac's annual cost and revenue functions respectively. We 
         now want to find <m>R(0)</m> given that <m>C(0) = 150</m>. We solve

           <mrow> P(0) \amp = R(0) - C(0) </mrow>
           <mrow> -117 \amp = R(0) - 150 </mrow>

         Sanalac's revenue in 2001 was $3,300.

      <title> Area And The Definite Integral </title>

      <p>
       We now explore the application of area to solving problems involving the <em>total change</em> (or <em>net change</em> or <em>total accumulation</em>) in a function. 
       Recall <xref ref="farbman" />, in which Farbman's cost, <m>C(x)</m>, was increasing at a constant rate of $92.47 per additional unit manufactured 
       (<m>MC(x) = 92.47</m>).  We found the cost function to be <m>C(x) = 92.47x + 597.52</m> so that the total, or net, change in cost the company incurs between the 
       third and seventh dresser they manufacture is  <m>C(7) - C(3) = 369.88</m>, or $369.88.  Notice the region under the marginal cost function 
       over the interval <m>[3,7]</m> forms a rectangle of height 92.47 and width of 4. So, the area of this region is <m>(92.47)(4) = 369.88</m>.  
      </p>  


      <image source="ch-4/c41.png" width="80">

      <fact xml:id="total-change">
       <statement>
        <term> Total Change In <m>F</m> </term>:  Suppose <m>f \geq 0</m> is continuous on the interval <m>[a,b]</m>, and <m>f</m> is the 
        rate of change of <m>F</m> (this means <m>F' = f</m>, or <m>F</m> is antiderivative of <m>f</m> ). Then the <term> total change </term> in <m>F</m> as <m>x</m> 
        goes from <m>a</m> to <m>b</m> is the area between the graph of <m>f</m> and the <m>x</m>-axis from <m>x=a</m> to <m>x=b</m>.
       </statement>
      </fact> 

      <p>
       In the picture above, the region under <m>MC(x)</m> is a rectangle, and so we have a nice formula to calculate the area. Of course, the above fact is also 
       true for more complicated curves. Suppose instead that Farbman's marginal cost is given to be
        <me>
         MC(x) = x^4 - 28x^3 + 272x^2 - 1088x + 1586.
        </me>
       and again we want to know the total change in cost between the third and seventh dresser. That is, we want to know <m>C(7) - C(3)</m>. <xref ref="total-change" />
       tells us 
        <me>
          C(7) - C(3) = \textrm{Area under} \: MC(x) \: \textrm{from} \: x=3 \: \textrm{to}\:  x=7
        </me>
      </p>

      <image source="ch-4/c42.png" width="80">

      <p>
       So, how do we calculate this area? Well, we know how to calculate the area of rectangles, so let's start there.
      </p>

        Left Endpoint Approximation

       <image source="ch-4/c43.png" width="80">

      <p>
       In the above picture, the interval <m>[3,7]</m> is divided into 4 smaller intervals, called subintervals, the length of each being 1 unit.  This is the width of each 
       rectangle, <m>R_i</m> for <m>1 \leq i \leq 4</m>.  Notice that for the height of each rectangle <m>R_i</m> we used the marginal cost value at the left endpoint of each 
       of the 4 smaller intervals.  If <m>A_i</m> denotes the area of <m>R_i</m> for <m>1 \leq i \leq 4</m>, then
        <ul>
         <li>
          <m> A_1 = 1 \cdot MC(3) = 95</m>
         </li>

         <li>
          <m> A_2 = 1 \cdot  MC(4) = 50</m>
         </li>

         <li>
          <m> A_3 = 1 \cdot MC(5) = 71</m>
         </li>

         <li>
          <m> A_4 = 1 \cdot MC(6) = 98 </m>
         </li>
        </ul>
       Now, the area under <m>MC(x)</m>, or in other words, the total change in 
       cost <m>C</m> from <m>x=3</m> to <m>x=7</m> is approximately

         <mrow> \textrm{Total Change In} \: C \amp = C(7) - C(3) </mrow>

         <mrow>  \amp  = 314.</mrow>
        </md>
      </p>

      <p>
      It is worthwhile pointing out here that the choice to use the left endpoints of the subintervals to form our rectangles was arbitrary. We could have have 
      evaluated the marginal cost function at any number we like within each subinterval to determine the height of the rectangles. We also could have 
      arbitrarily chosen the width of each rectanlge. Below are two more illustrations using the right endpoint and midpoint of each interval to determine the height.
      </p>

      <p>
       That the left and right endpoint approximations are the same is coincidence. Most often, choosing different test points to determine the height of the approximating
       rectangles will give different area approximations. Regardless, we can make these approximations better and better by continuing to increase the number of inscribed
       rectangles. The sum of the areas of these approximating rectangles is referred to as a <term> Riemann Sum </term>. Look how close we can approximate the acutal
       area using only 40 rectangles. This, of course, provides a better approximaition of the total change in <m>C(x)</m>.

      <p>
       Letting <m>A_i, 1 \leq i \leq 40</m> denote the area of each rectangle, and using summation notation for the <term> Riemann Sum </term>,
        <me>
          C(7) - C(3) \approx \sum_{i=1}^{40} A_i = A_1 + A_2 + A_3 + \cdots + A_{40} =307.53.
        </me>
      </p>

      <p>
       Let <m>n</m> represent the number of rectangles we use. Then the Riemann Sum has the form
        <me>
         \sum_{i=1}^{n} A_i.
        </me>
       The actual area under the graph of <m>MC(x)</m> is the LIMIT of the Riemann Sums as <m>n \to \infty</m>. Again, recalling <xref ref="total-change" />
        <me>
          C(7)-C(3) = \textrm{Area under} \: MC(x) \: \textrm{from} \: x=3 \: \textrm{to}\:  x=7  = \lim_{n \to \infty} \sum_{i=1}^{n} A_i.
        </me>
       We have a special notation for the limit above. The symbol <m>\displaystyle \int_{x=3}^{7} MC(x) \: dx</m> is used for the above limit, and is referred to as a 
       <term>definite integral</term>. The numbers 3 and 7 at the bottom and top of the integral symbol are called <term>limits of integration</term>. Substituting and rewriting, 
       this becomes
        <me>
          \displaystyle \int_{x=3}^{7} MC(x) \: dx = C(7)-C(3) = \textrm{Area under} \: MC(x) \: \textrm{from} \: x=3 \: \textrm{to}\:  x=7

            Prior to the increase, DDX's revenue from monthly subscriptions was 135,000(3.25) = $438,750. Seven 
            months afte the increae, DDX's revenue was (135,000 - 30,800)(6.75) = $703,350. So, increasing the 
            monthly subscription fee caused a decrease of 30,800 in subscribers, but generated an additional $264,600
            in revenue. So, their stragety was successful.

          Obsere that initially the rate of savings is greater than the rate of cost. However, 
          the rate of savings declines with time, while the rate of cost increase with time. We need to determine

           of net savings. Using our answer from the previous part, to determine the net, maximal savings,
           we integrate from <m>x=0</m> to <m>x=7</m> to obtain:
           <md>
            <mrow> \int_{x=0}^{7} (S'(x) - C'(x)) \, dx \amp = \int_{x=0}^{7} (-.88x^2 - 2.64x + 61.6) \, dx</mrow>
            <mrow>  </mrow>
            <mrow> \amp = \left(-\frac{.88}{3}x^3 - 1.32x^2 + 61.6x\right)\Biggr|_{x=0}^{7} </mrow>
            <mrow>  </mrow>
            <mrow> \amp = 265.9 </mrow>
           </md> 
           where the answer above is rounded to one decimal place. We see that Puddy's net, maximal 
           savings from using the new equipment is $2,659. Geometrically, this is the area between 
           <m>S'(x)</m> and <m>C'(x)</m> over <m>[0,7]</m>, as depicted below.

     For individual consumers, this is simply a difference in dollar amounts.  With respect to the

     Both consumer surplus (CS) and producer surplus (PS) at equlibrium are represented as area in the graph below. 
     The demand model is the function <m>p=D(q)</m> while supply is represented by <m>p=S(q)</m>. Observe
     <m>E = (q_0,p_0)</m> is the equilibrium point so that <m>q_0</m> is the equilibrium quantity and
     <m>p_0 = S(q_0) = D(q_0)</m> gives the market equilbrium price.

     <image source="ch-4/c65.png" width="80">

     <p>
      We compute consumer and producer surplus using definite integrals as follows:
       <ul>
        <li> 
         Consumer Surplus = CS = <m>  \displaystyle \int_{q = 0}^{q_0}(D(q) - p_0)  \: dq </m> 
        </li>

        <li> 
         Producer Surplus = PS = <m>  \displaystyle \int_{q = 0}^{q_0}(p_0 - S(q))  \: dq </m> 
        </li>
       </ul>
     </p>

     <p>
      Equivalently, 
       <ul>
        <li> 
         Consumer Surplus = CS = <m>  \displaystyle \int_{q = 0}^{q_0} D(q)  \: dq - p_0 q_0 </m> 
        </li>

        <li> 
         Producer Surplus = PS = <m>  p_0 q_0 - \displaystyle \int_{q = 0}^{q_0} S(q) \: dq </m> 
        </li>
       </ul>
      where <m>p_0 q_0</m> is the revenue at equilibrium and 
      <m> \displaystyle \int_{q = 0}^{q_0} D(q)  \: dq</m> and  
      <m>\displaystyle \int_{q = 0}^{q_0} S(q)  \: dq</m> are referred to as the definite integral 
      portions of consumer and producer surplus respectively.  Note also that <m>(p,Q)</m> is often 
      used to represent the market equilibrium point instead of <m>(p_0,q_0)</m>.

      ADTF Distributors finds that the demand function for their new snow blower can be expressed as

      dollars, where <m>q</m> is the number of snow blowers. Similarly, the supply function is

      dollars, where <m>q</m> is the number of snow blowers.

          Using the quadratic formula we find one valid solution: <m>q = 25</m>. Since 
          <m>D(25) = S(25) = 77</m>, the equilibrium point is <m>E = (25,77)</m>. Thus, this market
          is in equlibrium (supply equals demand) when 25 snow blowers are supplied at a price $77. Hence,
          the ADTF Distributors' reveune at equilibrium is <m>(p_0)(q_0) = </m>(77)(25) = $1,925.

       <li> 
        Compute the consumer surplus at equilibrium for these snow blowers.

          Since <m>q_0 = 25</m> is the equilibrium quantity, and <m>p_0 = 77</m> gives the equilibrium

          which we can simplify and evaluate. However, let's find the consumer surplus by first

          we find that the consumer surplus in this market is 5,675-1,925 = 3,750. So, when supply

          we find that the producer surplus in this market is 1,925-1,425 = 500. So, when supply

     <title>Exponential Functions</title>  

    <p>
     Before you begin, you should review the properties of exponents as needed.
    </p> 

    <definition xml:id="def-exp-function">
     Let <m>b</m> be positive number that is not 1 (that is, <m>b &gt; 0</m>, <m>b \neq 1</m>). 
     Then <m>f(x) = b^x</m> is called an <term>exponential function</term>, <m>b</m> is called the 
     <term>base</term>.
    </definition>

    <p>
     For example, 
      <ul>
       <li> <m>3^x</m> </li>
       <li> <m>\left( \dfrac{1}{3}\right)^x</m> </li>
       <li> <m>(\sqrt{3})^x</m> </li>
      </ul> 
     etc., are exponential functions, while
      <ul>
       <li> <m>x^3</m> </li>
       <li> <m>\left( - \dfrac{1}{3}\right)^x</m> </li>
       <li> <m>1^x</m> </li>
      </ul> 
      etc., are not exponential functions. 
    </p>
      
    <p>
      Observe that using the properties of exponents <m>\left( \dfrac{1}{3}\right)^x</m> can be expressed 
      as <m>\left( \dfrac{1}{3}\right)^x  = (3^{-1})^{x} = 3^{-x}</m>. So, <m>3^{-x}</m> is an exponential 
      function with base <m>b = \frac{1}{3}</m>. Also observe that using the properties of exponents
      <m>3^{x+2} = 3^x \cdot 3^2 = 9 \cdot 3^x</m> is an exponential function with base <m>b = 3</m> while 
      <m>3^{2x} = (3^2)^x = 9^x</m> is an exponential function with base <m>b = 9</m>.
    </p>

    <p>
     Below are the general shapes for the graphs of exponential functions. Recall that <m>b^0 = 1</m> for every 
     real number <m>b</m>, so that <m>(0,1)</m> will be the <m>y</m>-intercept for <m>b^x</m>. Notice 
     that if <m>b &gt; 1</m> and <m>x &lt; 0</m> then <m>0 &lt; b^x &lt; 1</m>. Also, if 
     <m>0 &lt; b &lt; 1</m> and <m>x &gt; 0</m> then <m>0 &lt; b^x &lt; 1</m>. In any case, for any base, 
     <m>b</m>, <m>b^x &gt; 0</m> for every real number <m>x</m>.

     Take for instance <m>f(x) = 2^x</m>, (<m>b=2 &gt; 1</m>) and <m>g(x) = (1/2)^x = 2^{-x}</m> (<m>0 &lt; 
     b = 1/2 &lt; 1</m>). Note that <m>g(x) = f(-x)</m> (see the values in the table below) so that these graphs

    <p>
     Let <m>b &gt; 0</m>, <m>b \neq 1</m>, and <m>f(x) = b^x</m>. From the graphs above we can see that
      <ul>
       <li> dom(<m>f</m>) <m> = (-\infty, \infty)</m> </li>
       <li> rng(<m>f</m>) <m> = (0,\infty)</m> </li>
       <li> <m>f(x)</m> has <m>y</m>-intercept <m> = (0,1)</m> </li>
       <li> <m>f(x)</m> has no <m>x</m>-intercepts.  Hence <m>b^x = 0</m> has no solutions. 
            In fact, <m>b^x = y</m> has no solutions when <m>y \leq 0</m>.</li>
      </ul> 
     Also, if the bases <m> b_1</m> and <m>b_2</m> are such that <m>b_1 &lt; b_2</m>, then <m>b^{x}_1 &lt; b^{x}_2</m>

     You should also be able to see that if the base <m>b &gt; 1</m>, then <m>b^x \rightarrow \infty</m> as

     <title>Logarithmic Functions</title>  

    <p>
     A <term>logarithm</term> can be thought of as an exponent.  The notation <m>\log_{b}(x)</m> is read "log 
     (or logarithm) base <m>b</m> of <m>x</m>."  Logarithms have a special relationship with exponential functions, 
     as can be seen from the following definition.
    </p>  

    <definition xml:id="def-log"> 
     Let <m>b</m> be positive number that is not 1 (that is, <m>b &gt; 0</m>, <m>b \neq 1</m>).  Then
      <me>
        y = \log_{b}(x) \quad \textrm{means}  \quad b^y = x.
      </me>
    </definition> 

    <p>
     After making the appropriate substitutions we have
      <me>
       x = b^{\log_{b}(x)} \quad \textrm{and} \quad y = \log_{b}(b^y)  
      </me>
     In other words, provided the same base <m>b</m> is used, exponential functions and logarithms "undo" each other.
     As an example, <m>\log_{5}(25) = 2</m> since <m>5^2 = 25</m>.  In other words, <m>\log_{5}(5^2) = 2</m> 
     and <m>5^{\log_{5}(25)} = 25</m>.

    </definition>

    <p>
     Just as with exponential functions, the number <m>e</m> is an extremely important, 
     commonly used base for logarithmic functions.  When <m>e</m> is used as a base, 
     the notation changes from <m>\log_{e}(x)</m> to <m>\ln(x)</m> (where it is understood 
     that <m>e</m> is the base).  
    </p>

    <p>
     The function <m>g(x) = \ln(x)</m> is called the <term>natural logarithmic function</term>. 
     The graph of <m>f(x) = e^x</m> and <m>g(x) = \ln(x)</m> are given below.  Notice the 
     "inverse" relationship between the two functions.  Recall:
      <me>
       y = \ln(x) \quad \textrm{means}  \quad e^y = x.
      </me>
     so that <m>\ln(e^x) = x</m> for every real <m>x</m> and <m>e^{\ln(x)} = x</m> for every 
     <m>x &gt; 0</m>. That these functions are inversely related can be seen by observing that <m>g(x)</m> is
     the reflection of <m>f(x)</m> through the line <m>y=x</m>. Notice how the reflected points identified in the 
     graph have their <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> coordinates interchanged.

    It should be pointed out that <xref ref="fact-log-tool" /> remains valid for any logarithm, and not just the

    we can apply the natural logarithm to both sides and then solve the resulting equation:

           This means <m>(4,58)</m> is a point on the graph. In function notation, this

     Mingy's Construction Company recently purchased a $52,000 pickup truck.  Suppose this pickup truck 
     depreciates in value by 12.5% each year.  This percentage is used to reduce the value of the truck at 
     the end of each year, so that at the end of each year (or start of each new year) the value of the pick up 
     truck is 12.5% less.

        Find a general base <m>b</m> expoenetial model, <m>M(t) = y_0 b^t</m>, that gives the value of Mingy's truck 
        <m>t</m> years after it was purchased. Use your model to determine the value of the truck after 3 years. 
         <solution>

          <p>
            We first determine the intial amount, <m>y_0</m>, at time <m>t=0</m> (recall

           We are <em>given</em> that 12.5%, or .125, is the (actual) decay rate for the truck. This means

            .125 = 1-b
            </me> 
           and we find that b = .875 so that <m>M(t) = 52,000(.875)^t</m>. Notice that a decay (or depreciation) rate of

    <p>
     Exponential functions are commonly used to model the growth and decay of money. But, let's first revisit a topic introduced 
     in <xref ref="linear-models-applications" /> for comparison. In particular, recall <xref ref="ex-lorrie-simp-int" />.
    </p>
    
    <p>
     <term>Simple Interest</term> is interest computed only on the principal amount invested or borrowed. For this reason, when 
     money grows (or declines) according to a simple interest model, it does so linearly. 
    </p>

    <p>
     Let
      <ul>
       <li>
        <m>P</m> = principal dollar amount invested or borrowed
       </li>

       <li>
        <m>r</m> = yearly interest rate (as a decimal)
       </li>

       <li>
         <m>t</m> = number of years 
       </li>
      </ul>
     Then <m>I(t) = Prt</m> is the amount of (simple) interest earned (or owed) in <m>t</m> years. Notice that this is a linear 
     model with vertical intercept <m>(0,0)</m> and slope <m>m=Pr</m>. You should be aware that <m>t</m> may represent 
     a unit of time other than years, such as days, weeks, months, etc. So, pay attention to the given context for the 
     appropriate units. However, unless otherwise mentioned, we will assume <m>t</m> to be in years.
    </p>

    <example xml:id="ex-maggie-simple-interest">
     Maggie borrowed $4,000 at 3% simple interest for 9 months. How much interest will she pay? How much will 
     Maggie owe in 9 months?
      <solution>
       We use the simple interest formula with 
        <ul>
         <li>
          <m>P = 4,000</m> and  
         </li> 

         <li>
          <m>r= .03</m> 
         </li> 
        </ul>
       so that our model for this problem is 
        <me>
         I(t) = 4000(.03)t = 120t.
        </me>
       In  <m>t = \frac{9}{12} = \frac{3}{4}</m> years, 
        <me>
         I\left (\frac{3}{4} \right) = 120\left( \frac{3}{4} \right) = 90.
        </me>
       So, Maggie will pay $90 in simple interest.  In 9 months she will owe her principal and interest, which is
        <me>
         P + I = $4000 + $90 = $4,090. 
        </me>
      </solution>
   </example>

   <p>
    The total amount owed in <xref ref="ex-maggie-simple-interest" /> is referred to as a <em>future value</em>. In other words,
    $4,090 is the future value, <m>F</m>, of $4,000 invested at 3% simple interest for 9 nine months. In general, 
    the <em>future value</em>, <m>F</m>, of a principal amount <m>P</m> dollars in <m>t</m> years at a simple interest 
    rate <m>r</m> (as a decimal) is
     <me>
      F = P + I = P + Prt = P(1+rt).
     </me> 
   </p> 

   <p>
    Notice that we can solve this expression above for the principal amount (or present value) if we know the future 
    value <m>F</m>:
     <me>
      P = \frac{F}{1+rt}

     Larry owes $6,500 to Margaret.  The loan is payable in one year at 5\% simple interest. Margaret needs cash immediately, 
     so she decides to sell the loan to a bank 4 months before it is due. The bank wants an 8% return. 
     How much should the bank pay?

    Treasury Bills, or T-bills, often involve simple interest calculations. A T-bill is a <em>simple discount loan</em>, 
    meaning the interest is deducted in advance of the loan, but the full value of the loan must be repaid. 
    T-bills are short term discount loans by investors, backed by the U.S. Treasury Department. 
   </p>

   <example xml:id="ex-t-bill">
    An investor bought a 10 month, $400 T-bill that sold at a simple discount rate of 3%. 
    Find the interest earned on the T-bill, the price of the T-bill, and the simple interest rate

      Using <xref ref="simple-interest"/> with <m>t=\frac{10}{12}</m>, the interest is calculated

    <title>Compound Interest </title>

   <p>
    <term> Compound interest</term> is interest on both the initial principal and the accumulated 
    interest from previous periods. Because of this, compound interest is calculated using exponential models. 
    Under the same interest rate, compound interest will make an amount of money grow faster than 
    simple interest, which is calculated only on the principal amount (recall that simple interest 
    is linear).

    <title> Continuous Compounding </title>

   <p>
    Let's look at the effect of increasing the number of yearly compounding periods on an investment. For 
    simplicity, suppose $1 is invested at an annual interest rate of 100% for <m>t=1</m> year, compounded 
    <m>n</m> times a year. For our calculations we use <xref ref="compound-future"/> with <m>P=r=1</m>. 
    The future value of $1 at <m>t=1</m> year is then
     <me>
      A(1) = F = \left(1 + \dfrac{1}{n}\right)^n
     </me>
    Let's look at how $1 grows as we increase <m>n</m>. We round to the nearest cent:
     <ul>
      <li>
       <m>n=1</m> (yearly): <m> \quad F = (1+1)^1 = $2</m>
      </li>

      <li>
       <m>n=2</m> (semiannual): <m> \quad F = \left(1+\dfrac{1}{2}\right)^2 \approx $2.25</m>
      </li>

       <li>
       <m>n=4</m> (quarterly): <m> \quad F = \left(1+\dfrac{1}{4}\right)^4 \approx $2.44</m>
      </li>

      <li>
       <m>n=12</m> (monthly): <m> \quad F = \left(1+\dfrac{1}{12}\right)^{12} \approx $2.61</m>
      </li>

      <li>
       <m>n=52</m> (weekly): <m> \quad F = \left(1+\dfrac{1}{52}\right)^{52} \approx $2.69</m>
      </li>

      <li>
       <m>n=365</m> (daily): <m>\quad F = \left(1+\dfrac{1}{52}\right)^{365} \approx $2.71</m>
      </li>
     </ul> 
    We can continue to increase the number of compounding periods by letting <m>n \to \infty</m>. Recalling 
    <xref ref="def-e"/>, we have 
     <me>
      \lim_{n \to \infty} \left( 1 + \dfrac{1}{n}\right)^n \approx $2.72
      </me>  
    We obtain similar results using any interest rate. Indeed, for any value <m>r</m> one can show 
     <me> 
      \lim_{n \to \infty} \left( 1 + \dfrac{r}{n}\right)^n = e^r
     </me> 
    Using the properties of limits, we can continue to extend the above result. For the compound interest model 
    <m>A(t) = P\left(1 + \dfrac{r}{n} \right)^{nt}</m>, we obtain the following by letting the number of compounding 
    perionds increase without bound:
     <md>
      <mrow> \lim_{n \to \infty}A(t) \amp =\lim_{n \to \infty} \left(  P \left(1 + \dfrac{r}{n} \right)^{nt} \right) </mrow>
      <mrow> </mrow>
      <mrow> \amp = P \left[ \lim_{n \to \infty} \left( 1 + \dfrac{r}{n} \right)^{nt} \right]</mrow>
      <mrow> </mrow>
      <mrow> \amp = P \left[ \lim_{n \to \infty} \left( 1 + \dfrac{r}{n} \right)^{n} \right]^t</mrow>
      <mrow> </mrow>
      <mrow> \amp = P \left[ e^r \right]^t</mrow>
      <mrow> </mrow>
      <mrow> \amp = Pe^{rt}</mrow>
     </md>     
   </p>

   <p>
    The <term>continuous compounding</term> model is the result of letting the number of yearly compounding periods tend 
    to infinity in the compound interest model. As we observed above, if we let the number of yearly compounding periods, 
    <m>n</m>, tend to infinity in the model given in <xref ref="compound-future"/>, then we obtain the 
    <em>continuous compounding</em> model 
     <me>
      A(t) = Pe^{rt},
     </me>
    where as before, <m>P</m> is the principal amount invested or borrowed, <m>r</m> is the annual interest rate as a decimal,
    and <m>t</m> is time in years. As with our other interest models, continous compounding has a future and present value form. 
    The present value form is found by rewriting the above model in terms of <m>P</m>.

    Norm, Cliff, and Woody are saving money to travel cross county on a snipe hunt. They decide to invest their money with 
    Howe's Investment Firm, which is the only finanacial establishment they could only find that offered accounts with 
    continuous compounding.
    <ol marker="(a)">
     <li> 
      How much will Norm, Cliff, and Woody have if they invest $750 in an account with interest rate 3.86% compounded 
      continuously for 15 months? How much did they earn in interest?
      <solution>  
       Using <xref ref="cont-comp-future" /> with the given information, the continous compouding model is
        <me>
         A(t) = 750e^{.0386t}.
        </me>
       Evaluating at <m>t=\dfrac{15}{12}</m> years gives 
        <me>
         A\left( \dfrac{15}{12}\right) = 750e^{.0386 \cdot \frac{15}{12}} \approx 787.07.
        </me>
       In 15 months, Norm, Cliff, and Woody will have $787.07. This means they earned $787.07 - $750 = $37.07 in interest.
      </solution>
     </li>

     <li> 
      If the desired amount in 15 months is $977, how much should Norm, Cliff, and Woody invest? If they let this investment grow 
      for an additional 6 months, how much interest would they earn.
      <solution>  
      <p>
       Using <xref ref="cont-comp-present" /> with <m>F = 977</m>, <m>r=.0386</m> and <m>t=\dfrac{15}{12}</m>,
        <me>
         P = 977e^{-.0386 \cdot \frac{15}{12}} \approx 930.98.
        </me>
       If Norm, Cliff, and Woody want $977 in 15 months, they should invest $930.98 in the account.
      </p> 

      <p>
       In this case their their continuous compounding model is 
        <me>
         A(t) = 930.98e^{.0386t}.
        </me>
       If they let their investment grow for an additional 6 months, then evaluating at <m>t=\dfrac{21}{12}</m> gives 
        <me>
         A\left( \dfrac{21}{12}\right) = 930.98e^{.0386 \cdot \frac{21}{12}} \approx 996.04.
        </me>
       In this case, Norm, Cliff, and Woody would earn $996.04 - $930.98 = $65.06 in interest.

    <title> APR and APY </title>
     <p>
      <term>APR (the annual percentage rate)</term>, also called the <em>nominal rate</em>, represents 
      the stated yearly interest rate. While we will also use this term for investments, it is often 
      used as the rate charged for borrowing money, including fees. APR does not take into consideration 
      the number of compounding periods per year. For our purposes, it would be like the rate <m>r</m> used 
      in all our interest models above.
     </p>

     <p>
      <term> APY (the annual percentage yield)</term>, also called the <em>effective rate</em>, describes 
      the interest rate under the effect of compounding periods. Because APY includes a calculation of 
      how compounded interest impacts the rate over the course of one year, the APY will usually be larger 
      than the APR. Also, the greater the number of yearly compounding periods, the bigger the difference 
      between the APR and APY.
     </p>

     <p>
      Suppose we are given an APR (annual interest rate) of <m>r</m> compounded <m>n</m> times a year. Then in 
      <m>t</m> years $P will grow according to the compound interest model
       <me>
        A(t) = P\left(1+\dfrac{r}{n} \right)^{nt}.
       </me>
      The associated APY is the (actual) growth rate of this exponential model. Rewriting the above model,
       <me>
         A(t) = P\left[\left(1+\dfrac{r}{n} \right)^{n}\right]^t
       </me> 
      and we see that <m>A(t)</m> is a base <m>b=\left(1+\dfrac{r}{n} \right)^{n}</m> exponential growth 
      model. Recall <xref ref="remark-growth-decay-rates"/>. The (actual) growth rate, or APY, associated with 
      <m>A(t)</m> is <m>b-1</m>, or 
       <me>
        \left(1+\dfrac{r}{n} \right)^{n} - 1.
       </me>
      This value is the associated APY and for a fixed APR, will incease as <m>n</m> increases. 
     </p>
      
     <definition xml:id="def-apy"> 
      With an APR (or annual interest rate) of <m>r</m> compounded <m>n</m> times a year, the <term>APY (annual percentage yield, 
      or effective rate)</term>, denoted <m>r_{E}</m>, is
       <me>
        \textrm{APY} \: = r_{E} = \left(1 + \dfrac{r}{n} \right)^{n} - 1.
       </me>
      In the case of continuous compounding, the APY is
        <me>
        \textrm{APY} \: = r_{E} = e^r - 1.
       </me>
     </definition>

     <p>
      For example, suppose $<m>P</m> is invested at an annual rate (APR) of 2.5%. The APY is the (actual) 
      growth rate of this investment, which increase with the compounding periods:
       <ul>
        <li>
         Quarlterly compounding:
          <me>
           \textrm{APY} \: = r_{E} =\left(1 + \dfrac{.025}{4} \right)^{4} - 1 \approx .025235
          </me>
        </li>

        <li>
         Montly compounding:
          <me>
           \textrm{APY} \: = r_{E} =\left(1 + \dfrac{.025}{12} \right)^{12} - 1 \approx .025288
          </me>
        </li>

        <li>
         Daily compounding:
          <me>
           \textrm{APY} \: = r_{E} =\left(1 + \dfrac{.025}{365} \right)^{365} - 1 \approx .025314
          </me>
        </li>

        <li>
         Continuous compounding:
          <me>
           \textrm{APY} \: = r_{E} =e^{.025} - 1 \approx .025315
          </me>
        </li>
       </ul>
     </p>

     <p>
      Because the APY gives the (actual) growth rate of an investment, it can be used to determine which account 
      provides a better investment option.
     </p>

     <example>
      Chambers and Crane Investment Bank is offering Account 1 with an APR of 3.245% compounded semiannually and 
      Account 2 with an APR 3.223% compounded weekly. Which is the better investment option.
       <solution>
        While Account 1 has a higher APR, Account 2 offers more compounding periods. To compare, we find the APY 
        (or (actual) growth rate) for each account.
         <ul>
          <li>
           Account 1
            <me>
              \textrm{APY} \: = r_{E} =\left(1 + \dfrac{.03245}{2} \right)^{2} - 1 \approx .03271
            </me>
          </li>

          <li>
           Account 2
            <me>
              \textrm{APY} \: = r_{E} =\left(1 + \dfrac{.03223}{52} \right)^{52} - 1 \approx .03274
            </me>
          </li>
         </ul>
        Since the APY for Account 2 (3.274%) is highter than the APY for Account 1 (3.271%), Account 2

    <title>Ordinary Annuities</title>
   
   <p>
    An <term>annuity</term> is a sequence of <em>equal payments</em> made at <em>equal time periods</em> 
    (unlike one-time deposits or payments like we previously considered).  An <term>ordinary annuity</term> 
    is an annuity in which the payments are made to the account at the <em>end of each period</em>.  
   </p>

   <p>
    Because annuities involve a sequence of payments, determining the future value of an annuity can involve 
    adding a large number of terms together, which can be extremely tedious. Fortunately, using some algebra, we
    can find a nice formula to make our work much easier. So we begin with some albegra.
   </p> 

   <p>
    As a an example, consider the following equality. For any real number <m>x</m>, we have,
     <me> 
      (x-1)(1+x+x^2+x^3+x^4) = x^5 - 1.
     </me>
    When <m>x \neq 1</m> this is equivalent to
     <me>
      1+x+x^2+x^3+x^4 = \dfrac{x^5-1}{x-1}
     </me>
    Similarly 
     <me>
      1+x+x^2+x^3+x^4 + x^5 = \dfrac{x^6-1}{x-1}, \: \textrm{and} 
     </me>
     <me>
      1+x+x^2+x^3+x^4 + x^5 +x^6= \dfrac{x^7-1}{x-1} 
     </me>
    and so on. What will be useful to us here, is that the sum on the left can be computed using division. 
    In general, the following is true:
    </p>

    <fact xml:id="fact-geometric-series"> 
     <statement>
     For any natural number <m>m</m> and real number <m>x \neq 1</m>,  
      <me>
       1 + x +x^2+x^3+x^4+\cdot + x^{m-1} = \dfrac{x^m-1}{x-1}.
      </me>
     </statement>  
    </fact> 
    
   <p>
    Now, suppose we deposit $<m>P</m> at the end of each period for <m>m</m> total compounding periods at an 
    interest rate of <m>i</m> each period.  Note that <m>i</m> is NOT necessarily the annual rate.  To compare 
    with our previous work, if <m>r</m> were the annual interest rate and there were <m>n</m> compounding 
    periods per year, then we would use <m>i = \dfrac{r}{n}</m> as the interest rate per period. In other words, 
    using our new notation, we can rewrite our compound interest model as follows. For principal <m>P</m>, compounded
    <m>n</m> times a year for <m>t</m> years at an annual interest rate <m>r</m>
     <me>
      P \left( 1+ \dfrac{r}{n} \right)^{nt} = P\left(1+ i \right)^{m}
     </me>
    Now, using our compound interest model, with $<m>P</m> deposited at the end of each period, 
     <ul>
      <li>
       Accumulated amount from deposit 1 = <m>P(1+i)^{m-1}</m>
      </li>    

      <li>
       Accumulated amount from deposit 2 = <m>P(1+i)^{m-2}</m>
      </li>

      <li>
       Accumulated amount from deposit 3 = <m>P(1+i)^{m-3}</m>
      </li>
     </ul>

     <m>\vdots</m>

     <ul>
      <li>
       Accumulated amount from deposit m-3 = <m>P(1+i)^{3}</m>
      </li>

      <li>
       Accumulated amount from deposit m-2 = <m>P(1+i)^{2}</m>
      </li>

      <li>
       Accumulated amount from deposit m-1 = <m>P(1+i)</m>
      </li>

      <li>
       Accumulated amount from deposit m = <m>P</m>
      </li>
     </ul>
   </p> 

   <p>
    Let <m>F</m> represent the future value of this ordinary annuity.  Then <m>F</m> will equal the sum of 
    all these accumulated amounts.  Therefore, if we let <m>x=1+i</m> and use <xref ref="fact-geometric-series"/>

    Substituting <m>x = 1 + i</m> back into this expression gives the following ordinary annuity formula.

       After the 10 years is up, Cindy decides to invest the amount from her money market annuity into another account

       much will she have in her account in another 5 years? 
        <solution>
         We need to do this in two steps:
          <ul>
           <li>
            First, we use the compound interest formula <xref ref="compound-future"/> to determine the future value of

           <p>
           </p>

           <li>
            Next we calculate the amount that will be generated by Cindy's continued deposits using the ordinary annuity 
            formula (<xref ref="ordinary-annuity-future"/> given in <xref ref="ordinary-annuity-formula"/>) with 
            <m>P=950</m>, <m>i = \dfrac{.0124}{12}</m>, and <m>m=5 \cdot 12 = 60</m>.

          </ul>

          <p>
          </p>
         Finally, we add the two dollar amounts above to find the final value in Cindy's account:
          <me>
            $128,212.80 + $58,772.78 = $186,985.58

    Let's now look at the <em>present value of an ordinary annuity</em>. The question is, how much should be invested presently
    at a periodic interest rate of <m>i</m> to ensure a payment of $<m>P</m> can be made from the account at the end of each of 
    <m>m</m> periods. To ensure $<m>P</m> is in the account for the first payment (here, we are viewing <m>P</m> as the future value; 
    in other words <m>P</m> is playing the role of <m>F</m> in <xref ref="compound-present"/>), 
     <me>
      \dfrac{P}{(1+i)}
     </me>
    must be depsoited presently. To ensure the second payment of $<m>P</m> (again, <m>P</m> is the future value) is in the 
    account by the end of the second period
     <me>
       \dfrac{P}{(1+i)^2}
     </me>
    must be depsoited presently. To ensure the third payment of $<m>P</m> (again, <m>P</m> is the future value) is in the 
    account by the end of the third period 
     <me>
       \dfrac{P}{(1+i)^3}
     </me>
    must be depsoited presently. This pattern continues up to and including the final payment, for which 
     <me>
       \dfrac{P}{(1+i)^m}
     </me>
    must be depsoited presently to ensure the last payment can be made from the account. What we need to deposit, then, to ensure 
    <m>m</m> periodic payments of <m>P</m> (at the end of each period), is 
     <me>
      \dfrac{P}{(1+i)} + \dfrac{P}{(1+i)^2} + \dfrac{P}{(1+i)^3} + \cdots +  \dfrac{P}{(1+i)^m}.
     </me>
    Lertting <m>x=1+i</m> and factoring a <m>\dfrac{P}{x}</m> from each term, the present value, <m>PV</m>, of this ordinary annuity has the form
     <me>
      PV = \dfrac{P}{x} \left( 1 + \dfrac{1}{x} + \left(\dfrac{1}{x}\right)^2 + \cdots + \left(\dfrac{1}{x}\right)^{m-1} \right)
     </me>
    where <m>P</m> is the periodic pay-out amount. Using <xref ref="fact-geometric-series"/> this can be rewritten as
     <me>
      PV = \dfrac{P}{x} \left( \dfrac{ 1 - \left( \frac{1}{x}\right)^m }{1-\frac{1}{x}}\right) = P\left(\dfrac{1-x^{-m}}{x-1}\right).
     </me>
    Substituting <m>1+i</m> back in for <m>x</m> gives the following: 
   </p>

   <fact xml:id="payout-annuity-formula">

    <term>Loan amortization</term> is the process of paying off the interest and principal balance on a loan

   In general, <term>equity</term> is defined to be <em>total assets</em> minus <em>total liabilities</em>. 
   For a homeowner or property owener, <term>equity</term> would be the (market) value of the home 
   or property less the amount still owed. To calculate the amount still owed (the outstanding debt), we view the 
   remaining payments left on the laon as an ordinary annuity, and find its present value. This amount would be 
   the amount still owed on the loan. Consider the following example. 
   </p>
   
   <p>
   H.E. Pennypacker, a wealthy American industrialist, is looking to purchase a sliver mine in the mountains 
   of Peru. In need of loan, Pennypacker finances the entire value of the mine and borrows $500,000,000 from 
   Varnsen Savings and Loan. The terms of the loan stipulate that Pennypacker pay  an annual interest rate of 
   2.25%  compounded monthly for 10 years. 
   </p>

   <p> 
   Let's determine Pennypacker's monthly payments to Varnsen Savings and Loan. We can think of this two ways:
    <ol>
     <li>
      We can view $500,000,000 as the present value of an ordinary annuity formed by Pennypacker's sequence of 
      payments.. In this case, using 
      <xref ref="amortization"/> to find the amortization payments,
       <me>
        P = 500,000,000 \left( \dfrac{\frac{.0225}{12}}{1-\left(1+\dfrac{.0225}{12}\right)^{-120}}\right) \approx 4,656,868.59
       </me> 
      so that Pennypacker's monthly payments are $4,656,868.59. 
     </li>
     <li>
      Using the compound interest model  
       <me>
        A(t) = 500,000,000\left(1+\frac{.0225}{12}\right)^{12t}   
       </me>
      we find the future value of the loan to be
       <me>
        F = A(10) = 500,000,000\left(1+\frac{.0225}{12}\right)^{12 \cdot 10} \approx 626,029,455.95, 
       </me>
      or $626,029,455.95. Viewing this as the future value of an ordinary annuity and using 
      <xref ref="sinking-fund"/> to find the payments,
       <me>
        P = 626,029,455.95 \left( \frac{ \frac{.0225}{12} }{ \left(1+\frac{.0225}{12}\right)^{120} - 1} \right)  \approx 4,656,868.59,
       </me>
      and again we find Pennypacker's payments are $4,656,868.59. 
     </li>
    </ol>
   So, if Pennypacker pays the loan in 120 monthly payments of $4,656,868.59, he will end up paying 
    <me>
     4,656,868.59(120) - 500,000,000 = 58,824,230.92
    </me> 
   or $58,824,230.92 in interest. 
   </p>

   <p>
    Suppose that Pennypacker wants to pay off his loan halfway through the term, with 60 payments remaining. 
    How much does Pennypacker owe Varnsen Savings and Loan? To determine the amount owed, we find the 
    present value of the annuity defined by these 60 remaining payments using <xref ref="annuity-present-value"/>:  
    <me>
     PV = 4,656,868.59 \left(\frac{1-\left(1+\frac{.0225}{12}\right)^{-60}}{ \frac{.0225}{12}}\right)
      \approx 264,034,561.60

    If Pennypacker wants to pay off the laon at the end of the fifth year (after 60 payments), he owes Varnsen 
    Savings and Loan $264,034,561.60. In this case, Pennypacker paid 
     <me>
      (4,656,868.59(60)+264,034,561.60)- 500,000,000 = 43,446,677.06
     </me>
    or $43,446,677.06 in interest. 
   </p>

   <p>
    We can also use the present value, <m>PV</m>, above to calculate Pennypacker's equity after
    the fifth year of the laon. Assuming that the value of the silver mine remained constant, Pennypacker's 
    equity after his 60th payment is
     <md>
      <mrow> \textrm{Equity} \: \amp = \: \textrm{Value} \: - \: \textrm{Amount Owed} </mrow>
      <mrow> \textrm{Equity} \: \amp =  500,000,000  - 264,034,561.60 </mrow>
      <mrow> \textrm{Equity} \: \amp =  235,965,438.40 </mrow>
     </md> 
    Pennypacker's equity after the fifth year of the laon is $235,965,438.40 or about 47%.
