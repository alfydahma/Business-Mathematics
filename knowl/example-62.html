</h3>Kramerica is a car-leasing firm that stipulates early termination fees and annual mileage limits in their monthly lease agreements. In addition to paying a flat rate yearly maintenance fee for their cars, they are trying to decide how much to charge customers for additional maintenance on cars they lease. A study conducted by their Research Division determined that the rate of maintenance costs on a car leased for <span class="process-math">\(t\)</span> years will approximate<div class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="./knowl/thm-ftc.html">
\begin{equation*}
m(t) = 3\sqrt{t} + 1.5
\end{equation*}
</div>hundred of dollars per year. Find the accumulated maintenance cost Kramerica can expect from a 4 year lease. Use your answer to determine how much Kramerica should add to the monthly lease agreements to cover their maintenance fees for this lease period. <a href="" class="solution-knowl original" data-knowl="./knowl/solution-120-hidden.html" title="Solution 4.4.3.1"><span class="type">Solution</span><span class="period">.</span></a></article><span class="incontext"><a href="ftc-apps.html#example-62" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
