<body class="ignore-math"><article class="example example-like">DDX, a company specializing in podcasts and other audio content, decided to increase their monthly subscription fee from $3.25 to $6.75 in hopes of increasing their revenue. They expected to lose some customers, but hoped to retain enough of them to make up for that lost revenue. It turned out that the rate of change of the total number of subscribers is modeled by<div class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="./knowl/thm-ftc.html">
\begin{equation*}
s(n) = -10n-9
