<div class="para">One application of the second derivative is that <span class="process-math">\(f''(x)\)</span> will give the instantaneous rate of change of <span class="process-math">\(f'\text{.}\)</span> This has geometric consequences. <dfn class="terminology">Concavity</dfn> is related to the rate of change of a function's derivative which can be found by looking at the sign of the second derivative. A function <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> is <dfn class="terminology">concave up</dfn> where the first derivative, <span class="process-math">\(f'\text{,}\)</span> is increasing (that is, where <span class="process-math">\(f'' &gt; 0\)</span>), and <dfn class="terminology">concave down</dfn> where the first derivative, <span class="process-math">\(f'\text{,}\)</span> is decreasing (that is, where <span class="process-math">\(f'' &lt; 0\)</span>).  A point where concavity changes is called an <dfn class="terminology">inflection point</dfn>. Geometrically, a function is concave up on intervals where the graph "bends up", or is above its tangent lines. The function is concave down on intervals where the graph "bends down", or is below its tangent lines.</div>
