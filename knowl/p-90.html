<div class="para">To find the slope of the tangent line <span class="process-math">\(T\)</span> at the point <span class="process-math">\(P= (x,f(x))\text{,}\)</span> let <span class="process-math">\(L_1\)</span> be the secant line through the points <span class="process-math">\((x,f(x))\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\((x+h,f(x+h))\text{.}\)</span>  Let's suppose <span class="process-math">\(h &gt; 0\text{.}\)</span>  Keep making <span class="process-math">\(h\)</span> smaller and smaller and smaller and smaller (that is, let <span class="process-math">\(h \rightarrow 0\)</span>), and each time you pick a smaller value for <span class="process-math">\(h\text{,}\)</span> draw another secant line through <span class="process-math">\((x,f(x))\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\((x+h,f(x+h))\text{.}\)</span>  You will end up with infinitely many secant lines (one for each value of <span class="process-math">\(h\)</span>) that get closer and closer to having the slope of the tangent line.  Look at the picture below, where only three of these lines are drawn. Starting at <span class="process-math">\(L_1\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(h\)</span> was made smaller to get to <span class="process-math">\(L_2\text{,}\)</span> and then smaller still to get to <span class="process-math">\(L_3\text{.}\)</span>  Notice how these lines approach the tangent line <span class="process-math">\(T\text{.}\)</span>
