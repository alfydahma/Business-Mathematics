<body class="ignore-math"><article class="example example-like">Let <span class="process-math">\(f(x) = \dfrac{x^2 -1}{x-1}\text{.}\)</span>  Let's investigate what happens to the <span class="process-math">\(f(x)-\)</span>values as <span class="process-math">\(x \longrightarrow 1\text{.}\)</span> <div class="para">For homework make a data chart as in the previous example.  You should again conclude that <span class="process-math">\(f(x) \longrightarrow 2\)</span> as <span class="process-math">\(x \longrightarrow 1\)</span>
</div> <div class="para">Let's take a look at the graph.  Notice that <span class="process-math">\(x=1\)</span> is not in the domain of this function.  So, we cannot evaluate <span class="process-math">\(f(1)\)</span> as in the previous example.  This also means there will not be a point on the graph above <span class="process-math">\(x=1\)</span> on the graph of <span class="process-math">\(f\text{.}\)</span> However, because <span class="process-math">\(x \rightarrow 1\)</span> does not require evaluation at <span class="process-math">\(x=1\text{,}\)</span> it still makes sense to talk about what happens as <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> approaches 1 since <span class="process-math">\(f(x)\)</span> is defined for every <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> close to 1. Below is the graph.</div> <div class="image-box" style="width: 100%; margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%;"><img src="external/ch-3/c4.png" class="contained"></div> <div class="para logical">
<div class="para">Notice that our conclusion is the same as in the previous example.  Also observe the similarities between the two graphs. This happens because</div>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{equation*}
f(x) = \dfrac{x^2 -1}{x-1} = \dfrac{(x -1)(x+1)}{x-1} \quad \stackrel{x \neq 1}{=} \quad x+1 
\end{equation*}
</div>
<div class="para">In other words <span class="process-math">\(\dfrac{x^2 -1}{x-1} = x+1\)</span> for every value of <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> except <span class="process-math">\(x=1\text{,}\)</span> which is why both functions approach the same value as <span class="process-math">\(x \rightarrow 1\text{.}\)</span>  The difference this time is that <span class="process-math">\(f(1)\)</span> is NOT defined. So, again we <span class="process-math">\(f(x) \rightarrow  2\)</span> as <span class="process-math">\(x \rightarrow 1\text{,}\)</span> but this time <span class="process-math">\(f(1)\)</span> is UNDEFINED.</div>
