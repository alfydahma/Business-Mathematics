<dfn class="terminology">Supply and demand</dfn> refers to the relationship between the quantity of a commodity that producers wish to sell at various prices and the quantity that consumers wish to buy at various prices. It is the main model of price determination used in economic theory. The price of a commodity is determined by the interaction of supply and demand in a market. The resulting price is referred to as the <dfn class="terminology">equilibrium price</dfn> and represents an agreement between producers and consumers of the good. In equilibrium the quantity of a good supplied by producers equals the quantity demanded by consumers. This, of course, is referred to as the  <dfn class="terminology">equilibrium quantity</dfn>.</div>
