</h3>Bound-2-Read was a national chain of bookstores that failed to respond quickly to the digital age. In fact, their annual revenue was 411 million dollars at the end of the fiscal year 1996, but by the end of fiscal year 2001 was down to 296.9 million dollars. We will assume that the annual revenue for Bound-2-Read continued to decrease according to an exponential decay model. <ol class="lower-alpha">
