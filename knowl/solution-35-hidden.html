<body class="ignore-math"><div class="solution solution-like">With the cost per unit given as $10.75, we have<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{equation*}
C(d) = 10.75d + F
\end{equation*}
</div>To find <span class="process-math">\(F\)</span> we use the fact that CVL's total cost for producing <span class="process-math">\(d=98\)</span> units is $1523.82. That is<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{equation*}
C(98) = 10.75(98) + F = 1523.82    
\end{equation*}
</div>which gives <span class="process-math">\(F= 470.32\)</span> so that<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{equation*}
C(d) = 10.75d + 470.32
\end{equation*}
</div>From the cost model above we see that CVL's fixed costs are $470.32 Observe also that the cost per unit is the slope <span class="process-math">\(m=10.75\)</span> of <span class="process-math">\(C(d)\text{.}\)</span> So, CVL's cost increase by $10.75 for every addtional unit of the antidresspant drug they produce. <div class="para">Make sure you are aware of the role the variables play when you work through these examples. For this model, the input variable is <span class="process-math">\(d\)</span> which represents the number of units of the antidepressant drug produced by CVL. The output variable is <span class="process-math">\(C(d)\)</span> which represents CVL's cost in dollars for producing <span class="process-math">\(d\)</span> units of the antidpressant drug. You should take a minute to identify the variables and write a sentence to describe them as you work through all these examples.</div>
