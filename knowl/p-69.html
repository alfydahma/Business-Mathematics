<div class="para">Let's take a look at the graph.  Notice that <span class="process-math">\(x=1\)</span> is not in the domain of this function.  So, we cannot evaluate <span class="process-math">\(f(1)\)</span> as in the previous example.  This also means there will not be a point on the graph above <span class="process-math">\(x=1\)</span> on the graph of <span class="process-math">\(f\text{.}\)</span> However, because <span class="process-math">\(x \rightarrow 1\)</span> does not require evaluation at <span class="process-math">\(x=1\text{,}\)</span> it still makes sense to talk about what happens as <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> approaches 1 since <span class="process-math">\(f(x)\)</span> is defined for every <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> close to 1. Below is the graph.</div>
