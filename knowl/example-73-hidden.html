<body class="ignore-math"><article class="example example-like">MyLeatherDream (MLD) has a webpage customers can use to design and order custom leather guitar cases. However, traffic has been slow, so MLD hires VL Consultants to help advertise their site.  Before VL Consultants launches their advertising campaign MLD has 3,800  total visits to their site.  The total number of visits grows exponentially and is up to 5,800 site visits four days after the start of the ad campaign. <ol class="lower-alpha">
<li><div class="para">Find a base <span class="process-math">\(e\)</span> exponential model <span class="process-math">\(G(t)\)</span> that gives the total number of visits to MLD's website in hundreds of visits, where <span class="process-math">\(t\)</span> is the number of days after the start of the ad campaign. Use your model to identify the continuous growht rate, then determine how many site visits MLD has 12 days after the start of the ad campaign. <a href="" class="solution-knowl original" data-knowl="./knowl/solution-148-hidden.html" title="Solution a.1"><span class="type">Solution</span><span class="period">.</span></a>
