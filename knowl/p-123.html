<div class="para">Notice that in the picture on the left, the slopes of tangent lines get larger from left to right. In other words, the deriviate increases, which means the second derivative is positive. In the picture on the right, the slopes of tangent lines get smaller from left to right. In other words, the deriviate decreases, which means the second derivative is negative. Again, an inflection point is a point where concavity changes. That is, a point about which <span class="process-math">\(f''\)</span> changes sign.</div>
