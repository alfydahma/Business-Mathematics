<div class="para">In general, if we know <span class="process-math">\(f'(c_1) = 0\text{,}\)</span> and the sign of the derivative changes from negative to positive in some small neighborhood containing <span class="process-math">\(c_1\text{,}\)</span> then <span class="process-math">\((c_1, f(c_1))\)</span> will be a ``valley" on the graph of <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> (<em class="emphasis">this is because these sign changes of the derivative tell us that <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> changes from decreasing to increasing, and so must ``bottom out" at <span class="process-math">\(c_1\)</span></em>).  In this case we call <span class="process-math">\(f(c_1)\)</span> a relative (or local) minimum value of <span class="process-math">\(f\text{.}\)</span>  ``Relative" because, as you can see in the above picture, <span class="process-math">\(f(c_1)\)</span> is NOT the smallest function value.  It is the smallest, however, relative to the <span class="process-math">\(f(x)\)</span>-values for <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> near <span class="process-math">\(c_1\text{.}\)</span> Similarly if we know <span class="process-math">\(f'(c_2) = 0\text{,}\)</span> and the sign of the derivative changes from positive to negative (<em class="emphasis">which means <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> goes from increasing to decreasing, so must ``max out"</em>) in some small neighborhood containing <span class="process-math">\(c_2\text{,}\)</span> then <span class="process-math">\((c_2, f(c_2))\)</span> will be a ``peak" on the graph of <span class="process-math">\(f\text{.}\)</span> In this case we call <span class="process-math">\(f(c_2)\)</span> a relative (or local) maximum value of <span class="process-math">\(f\text{.}\)</span> Below is a more formal definition of these concepts.</div>
