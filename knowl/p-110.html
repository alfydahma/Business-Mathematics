<div class="para">We have a similar situation to the one in the above picture if the graph of <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> comes to a sharp point at <span class="process-math">\(c_1\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(c_2\text{.}\)</span> The difference is that the derivative is not 0 at <span class="process-math">\(c_1\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(c_2\)</span> in this case, but does not exist at these values instead. In other words, <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> is non-differentiable at <span class="process-math">\(c_1\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(c_2\text{.}\)</span> The reason is because <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> does not have a unique tangent line (or unique direction) at these points. This scenario is not as important as the one above for our applications of the derivative, but you should be aware of difference.  See the picture below for an illustration.</div>
