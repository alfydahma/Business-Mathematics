<div class="para">The <dfn class="terminology">continuous compounding</dfn> model is the result of letting the number of yearly compounding periods tend to infinity in the compound interest model. As we observed above, if we let the number of yearly compounding periods, <span class="process-math">\(n\text{,}\)</span> tend to infinity in the model given in <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/compound-future.html" title="Item 1">ItemÂ 1</a>, then we obtain the <em class="emphasis">continuous compounding</em> model</div>

\begin{equation*}

<div class="para">where as before, <span class="process-math">\(P\)</span> is the principal amount invested or borrowed, <span class="process-math">\(r\)</span> is the annual interest rate as a decimal, and <span class="process-math">\(t\)</span> is time in years. As with our other interest models, continous compounding has a future and present value form. The present value form is found by rewriting the above model in terms of <span class="process-math">\(P\text{.}\)</span>
