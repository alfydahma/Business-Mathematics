<body class="ignore-math"><article class="example example-like">Mingy's Construction Company recently purchased a $52,000 pickup truck.  Suppose this pickup truck depreciates in value by 12.5% each year.  This percentage is used to reduce the value of the truck at the end of each year, so that at the end of each year (or start of each new year) the value of the pick up truck is 12.5% less. <ol class="lower-alpha">

<em class="emphasis">Salvage value</em> is the book value of an asset after all depreciation has been fully expensed. The salvage value of an asset is based on what a company expects to receive in exchange for selling or parting out the asset at the end of its useful life. Mingy's truck has a salvage value of $5,500. How long will it take for Mingy's truck to reach its salvage value? Round <span class="process-math">\(t\)</span> to 2 decimal places then round up to the nearest whole year to answer. <a href="" class="solution-knowl original" data-knowl="./knowl/solution-154-hidden.html" title="Solution b.1"><span class="type">Solution</span><span class="period">.</span></a>
