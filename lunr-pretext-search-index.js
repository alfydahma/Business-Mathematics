  "body": " Graphs and Solutions of Equations  The Euclidean plane or rectangular coordinate system is formed by two perpendicular copies of the real line intersecting at the number of each line. Each number line is called an axis . A point in the plane, called an ordered pair , is specified by (horizontal position, vertical position). The horizontal axis is often labeled and the vertical axis . The point is called the origin . The plane is divided into 4 quadrants, as pictured below.    The labeling of the horizontal and vertical axes are arbitrary. We can use whatever letters or symbols we want to name or identify each axis. However they are labled, ordered pairs will always have the form (horizontal position, vertical position). In the graph above each ordered pair has the form .

  "body": " Equations of Lines   Standard Form  The standard form of a line is given by where and are real numbers and and are not both 0. Notice that the line in our previous example was given in standard form.  For this example we work with the line given in standard form (identify and for homework). Let's find points on this line, , by solving the equation for . Verify for homework that is the same as . Now we can substitute values for and compute :  When , we have which gives the point on .  When , we have which gives the point on .  When , we have which gives the point on .  All three of these points fall on the same line. Plot those points and graph this line for homework.    Slope of Line   Slope is a measure of the steepness of a line and is constant per unit change in the horizontal direction. We denot the slope with the letter . That is, if you move 1 unit to the right in the horizontal direction, then moving units in the vertical direction will get you to another point on the line. In the figure below notice that since we have to move up in the vertical direction as we move to the right in the horizontal direction.    Let and be any two distinct points on the line . Then the slope , denoted , of the line is given by   Notice in general that   if and only if and have the same sign if and only if the line rises from left to right     if and only if and have opposite signs if and only if the line falls from left to right      In applied mathematics, the variables in an equation or function (which we will get to later) are assigned a meaning. In this case, these equations or functions are called mathematical models . For example, equations representing a company's revenue, cost, and profit are often referred to as models.  Suppose a company's revenue is modeled by a line where points on the line have the form (units sold, revenue dollars). If the company makes \\$14.25 from selling 3 units and if they sell 6 units they make $28.50, find the slope of the line representing this company's revenue model. 2 points on this line are and . So, Notice that we can assign units to the slope in this problem: . This helps us see the slope of a line as a rate of change, an important concept in calculus. In this problem we now see that this company makes $4.75 per each additional unit sold. The graph is below.       Special Lines    Horizontal lines : Every point on a horizontal line has the same vertical coordinate regardless of the horizontal location. If we say this common coordinate is , then the horizontal line has equation . Note that the slope of any horizontal line is . Below is an example with .  Vertical lines : Every point on a vertical line has the same horizontal coordinate regardless of the vertical location. If we say this common coordinate is , then the vertical line has equation . Note that the slope of any vertical line is undefined. Below is an example with .        Slope-Intercept Form of a Line  Suppose a line has slope and -intercept . If is any other point on the line then Cross multiplying and solving for we get This is called the slope-intercept form of a line. In this context, we call the independent variable , or input variable and the dependent variable , or output variable . Using this language and recalling , we can interpret the slope as the change in ouput per the change in input. For instance, if the slope of a line is we say the output increase by 3 units as the input increases by 4 units. Equivalently, this means the output increases by .75 units as the input increases by 1 unit. Recalling in which we found , we can say this company's revenue (the output ) increases by $14.25 as the number of units sold (the input ) inreases by 3. Equivalently, the company's revenue (the output ) increases by $4.75 as the number of units sold increases by 1.  Graph using the -intercept and the slope. We rewrite this in slope-intercept form to get . So, the slope is and the -intercept is . Starting at , to get to another point on the line we can move up 3 units then left 4 units to get to the point or down 3 units then right 4 units to arrive at the point .     Suppose represents a company's cost in dollars for items produced, and their cost can be modeled with a line. If it costs them $30 to produce 2 items and their cost increases at a constant rate of $4 per additional unit produced, find the equation of the line modeling the company's cost in slope intercept form. We are given the point and slope . The line has the form , and substituting we have . We can solve for by substituting and . The desired line is . For homework, find the cost of producing 15 items then graph the line.     Point-Slope Form of a Line  If is a fixed point on a line and is any other point, then Cross multiplying we get This is called the point-slope form of the line .  The point-slope form is useful in putting a line in slope-intercept form. For instance, suppose the line contains the points and . Let's find the equation for . First we need the slope. Find it for homework. You should get . Now we can use either point to work with, say .     "

Throughout this text, you should continue to practice identifying each of these variables in context, and writing a sentence to interpret each. Notice that in each case, points on the graph of these mathematical models will have the form .  A hotel charges $159 per night plus an 11% nightly room tax. Assume that you will leave a $5 tip at the end of your visit regardless of the number of nights you stay.  Write a formula to model the total cost, , for nights in the hotel. Each night you stay you get charged $159 plus an 11% tax. For nights this means you'll pay . With the $5 tip the total cost for nights is In this context, we refer to as the input variable and as the output variable . So, the input variable  represents the number of nights stayed at the hotel. The output variable  represents the cost in dollars for staying at the hotel for nights.   How much will you pay for a 4 night stay? Evaluating at gives You will pay $710.96 to stay at the hotel for 4 nights.     Jane drives for a ride sharing service. Passengers are charged an $8.75 pickup fee and then pay an additional \\$2.25 per mile traveled. Find a linear equation to model the charge for a single ride. Use your model to determine how far a passenger traveled in Jane's car if they paid $33.50. Let   = total charge in dollars for a ride in Jane's car   = distance traveled in miles   We need a model in the form . Notice that passengers are responsible for the pickup fee of $8.75 with miles traveled. So, we know the point is on the line (which is the (or vertical) intercept). We are also given that passengers pay which means that 2.25 is the slope, . The desired model is In this problem, the input variable is , which represents the distance traveled in Jane's car in miles. The output variable , , is the total charge in dollars for riding miles in Jane's car. Finish the problem for homework.    We will use mathematical models analyze and solve many problems in business that involve cost , revenue , and profit .  A company's cost , , represents the amount of money that the company spends on the creation or production of goods or services, often measured over a set amount of time or by the number of units produced.  A company's revenue , , represents the amount of money brought in by a company's operations, often measured over a set amount of time or by the number of units sold.  Note that a business's revenue is its gross income before subtracting any expenses.  A company's profit , , represents the amount of money a company has left after paying for business expenses, often measured over a set amount of time or by the number of units produced. In other words   The next definition, related to cost, revenue, and profit, will be used in many examples to follow.  A company's break-even point is the point at which total cost and total revenue are equal. In other words, a company's break even point occurs when , or equivalently, when .  Tyler's company is making t-shirts to sell at the IUP football games this season. His fixed costs are $800 and he has variable costs of $3 per shirt. He will sell the shirts for $14 at the games.  Find an equation for , the total cost to produce shirts. As we will discuss again later, the linear cost model will have the form Since represents the number, or quantity, of t-shirts, the variable cost is . With the fixed costs given, the cost model for Tyler's company is In this context, the input variable is , which represents the number or quantity of t-shirts Tyler's company produces. The output variable , , is the total cost to Tyler's company when they produce t-shirts.   Find the cost to produce 80 t-shirts. Using the above linear model and evaluating at gives The cost to produce 80 t-shirts is $1,040   Find an equation for , the total revenue from selling shirts. As we will discuss again later, the linear revenue model will have the form So, the revenue model for Tyler's company is . In this context, the input variable is , which represents the number or quantity of t-shirts Tyler's company produces and sells. The output variable , , is the revenue made by Tyler's company when they produce and sell t-shirts.   Find the number of shirts that Tyler needs to sell to break even. We solve After rounding, we conclude that Tyler must sell 73 t-shirts to break-even.      Supply and demand refers to the relationship between the quantity of a commodity that producers wish to sell at various prices and the quantity that consumers wish to buy at various prices. It is the main model of price determination used in economic theory. The price of a commodity is determined by the interaction of supply and demand in a market. The resulting price is referred to as the equilibrium price and represents an agreement between producers and consumers of the good. In equilibrium the quantity of a good supplied by producers equals the quantity demanded by consumers. This, of course, is referred to as the equilibrium quantity .  Freeze Frame camera company supplies 50 cameras when the price is $175.69; when the price is $275.19, 100 of these cameras are available. Let represent the price of each camera and the quanity, or number of, cameras sold. Assme that Freeze Frame's supply model is linear and expressed as .  Using the inforamtion above, idenitfy two data points given by Freeze Frame's linear supply model. Since the linear model is given as , points on this line would have the form . That is, the quantity of cameras supplied by Freeze Frame represents the input variable , giving the horizontal location of a point. The price of each camera represents the output variable giving the vertical location of a point. Therefore, the given data can be expressed as the ordered pairs    Find Freeze Frame's linear supply model. We need the slope and -intercept. This means that for each additional camera suppled, the supply price increases by $1.99 To find the -intercept we use the point-slope form of a line:   Finally, we have determined that Freeze Frame's linear supply model is     Suppose the demand for Freeze Frame cameras is given by where again is price and the quantity. Determine the equilibrium price and quantity. Setting supply equal to demand we solve to get an equilibrium quantity of (after roudning) and an equilibrium price of $243.35. That is, the market for Freeze Frame cameras will be at equilibrium when 84 cameras (the equilibrium quantity) are supplied at a price of $243.35 (the equilbrium price). So, the equilibrium point is        Quick Copy buys an office machine for $5,200 that is expected to last for 8 years, at the end of which time its value will be $1,100. Let represent time in years since the office machine was purchased and represent the machine's value in dollars years after it was purchased. Assume the decline in value is constant each year, so that the depreciation is linear and the value of the machine in years can be expressed as .  Identify two data points given in this problems. Since the linear model is given as , points on this line would have the form . That is, the time in years since Quick Copy purchased the office machine represents the input variable , giving the horizontal location of a point. The value of the office machine represents the output variable giving the vertical location of a point. Therefore, the given data can be expressed as the ordered pairs    Find the depreciation model for the office machine purchased by Quick Copy. We need the slope and -intercept. This means that for each additional yaer Quick Copy owns the office machine, it's value deccreases by $512.50. We are given the -intercept so that the desired model is     Determine how long it will take the office machine to depreiciate to $2637.50     Simple Interest is a very common linear model, used in an example below. Let principal amount invested or borrowed, annual interest rate, = time in years, and = simple interest. Then the simple interest formula is Simple interest does not take into consideration any compounding. It's used to calculate interest on many CD's for a year or less. We will discuss simple interest in more detail in .   Lorrie deposits $5,000 into an account that pays simple interest at a rate of 4% per year. How much interest will she make in 18 months?

Observe that without a context given, the domain and range of any linear function is .  The examples in this section will be similar to those in except now we will express linear models using function notation. For instance, will instead be written as where we call the input variable (horizontal axis) and or the output variable (vertical axis).  Observe that the slope , , of a linear function gives the function's rate of change . Conversely, every rate of change can be viewed as the slope of a lline. Being able to interpret a slope as a rate of change will be extrememly important in many examples. For instance, if then the slope means that the output variable , or , decreases by 3 units as the input variable increases by 1 unit. Since many problems will be applications, you should also be able to associate units with the slope to help with interpretation. Again, with , So, if gives the value of an asset in hundreds of dollars, and represents time in years, then we interpret as: The value of asset decreases by 3 hunderd dollars (the change in ) per each additional year (the change in ).  Recall the definitions of cost, revenue, and profit given in . We now look at these basic business relationships as linear functions. To fix ideas, suppose below that cost, revenue, and profit are dollar amounts that depend on a certain number of items produced.   Cost Function = (cost per item)(number of items) + fixed costs  Revenue Function = (price per item)(number of items)  Profit Function = Revenue Function - Cost Function   Suppose that cost per item, price per item, and fixed costs. Using and respectively for cost, revenue, and profit, and number of items as the input variable, we have   Cost Function =   Revenue Function =   Profit Function =   So, with respect to the defintions given above, to find the number of units a company should produce and sell to break-even , you solve or equivalently, .  While the following functions are NOT linear, it is worth defining them here as they will appear in many examples.   Average Cost  Average Revenue  Average Profit   Note that in all the functions discussed above, we used number of items as the input variable. Another common input variable for these business functions is some unit of time. Also, the output units of these functions may be, say, thousands of dollars instead of dolllars. Make sure you read each problem carefully and understand the role each variable is playing.  The pharmaceutical company CVL produces an antidepressant drug that can be made for $10.75 per unit, . They sell this same drug for $24.53 per unit, . Their total cost for producing units is $1523.82.  Find CVL's cost function, , for this antidepressant drug. With the cost per unit given as $10.75, we have To find we use the fact that CVL's total cost for producing units is $1523.82. That is which gives so that From the cost model above we see that CVL's fixed costs are $470.32 Observe also that the cost per unit is the slope of . So, CVL's cost increase by $10.75 for every addtional unit of the antidresspant drug they produce. Make sure you are aware of the role the variables play when you work through these examples. For this model, the input variable is which represents the number of units of the antidepressant drug produced by CVL. The output variable is which represents CVL's cost in dollars for producing units of the antidpressant drug. You should take a minute to identify the variables and write a sentence to describe them as you work through all these examples.    Find CVL's revenue function, , for this antidepressant drug. With the price per unit given as , CVL'S revenue function for this drug is Notice that the price per unit is the slope of the revenue model. This means CVL's revenue increases by $24.53 for every addtional unit of the antidresspant drug they produce and sell.   Find the CVL's profit model, . Then find and interpret the average profit from producing and selling units of the antidepressant drug We subract the cost function from the revenue function: Notice that the slope of the profit model is . This means CVL's profit increases by $13.78 for every addtional unit of the antidresspant drug they produce and sell. Now, , which means CVL's profit from producing and selling 272 units of the antidepressant drug is $3,277.84. To calculate the average profit we divide this by the number of units: So, CVL's average profit from producing and selling units of the antidresspant drug is $12.05 per unit or Notice that the units for average profit (as well as average cost and average revenue) are     How many units of the drug should CVL produce and sell in order to break even? The break-even point occurs when CVL's profit is $0. So, we solve Recall that we always round up to identify the break-even point. So, CVL must produce and sell units of the antidepressant drug to break even. See the figure below for an illustration of the models and break-even point.

Note that means the car depreciates by \\$2,505 per year.   In the next example we'll be working with what is called a piecewise linear function . It's called piecewise because the function is split into multiple pieces over difference parts of its domain. When writing a piecewise function the rule identifying the action of the function is indicated on the left, with the corresponding input values to the right. For instance says that only when and only when . To evaluate, we have to identify which piece to use:  To evaluate at , we observe that so   To evaluate at , we observe that so     The graph of is below. Obsereve that the domain values that correspond to each piece of are identified using dotted lines along the horizontal axis. Why is there an open circle identifyng the piont ?    ADTF Distributors produces and sells Doggie DNA Kits to determine dog genetics. They find that that their annual net profit, in hundreds of dollars, is given by a piecewise linear function , where is the number of years since 2010.  In 2010 ADTF Distributors' profit from producing and selling Doggie DNA Kits was $10,042. Their profit was $21,634 in 2016. Find ADTF Distributors' linear profit model between these years. We are given the data points and . Finding the line through these points we see that ADTF Distributors' profit model from 2010 up to and including 2016 is    From 2016 to 2021, ADTF Distributors determined that their profit increased at rate of $4,974 per year until their profit reached $60,234 in 2021. Find ADTF Distributors' linear profit model between 2016 and 2021 We are given the slope to be and data point . Finding the line with these conditions we see that ADTF Distributors' profit model from 2016 to 2021 is    Epress as a piecewise linear model.  You should graph this piecewise functon for homwork.     Recall that every rate of change is the slope of line and vice versa. In particular, if then the rate of change of is its slope, (that is, if the input increases by 1 unit, then the output changes units). In business, marginal analysis compares the additional benefits (revenue and profit) derived from an activity and the extra cost incurred by the same activity. These additaional benefits\/costs are referred to as marginal revenue , marginal profit , and marginal cost .  As an example, Vandelay Industries, a global importer and exporter of fine latex goods, determines their profit in thousands of dollars from the years 2006 to 2020 can be model by where is the number of years since 2006. Looking at the slope of , we see that Vandelay Industries' profit increased at a constant rate of $38,460 per year from 2006 to 2020. So, Vandelay Industries' margainal profit from 2006 to 2020 was $38,460 per year. If we let denote the marginal profit function, we have (a constant function).  If a company's cost, revenue, or profit model is linear, then the corresponding marginal funciton will simply be the slope (as we found in the example above). The units for the output values of the marginal functions will therefore be same as those for the slope of the origianl business model. In subsequent chapters we will see that if our business model is NOT linear, the correspondong marginal function will in general NOT be constant.  ADTF Distributors manufacturers dining room chairs.

Beacuse the parabola opens up has a minimum ouptut value given by the coordinate of the vertex. Let's find the vertex. Using the formula given above for the coordinate (with and ) gives Evaluating, the coordinate is then so the vertex is and we can conclude that has a minimum value value of -1 (the smallest output value). Observe that the axis of symmetry is the vertical line . To find the intercepts we solve to get and . Hence, the intercepts are and .  Every quadratic can be written in vertex form  , where is the vertex. So, and . Using the method of completing the square , the quadratic in the above example has vertex form so that and as expected.    Applications With Quadratics  Recall the definitions for supply, demand and equilibrium given in . Both supply and demand functions in some given market relate price and quantity , and we often use as the input variable so that the supply and demand functions have the form and . The role of these variables can change, however, so make sure you read the problems carefully.  The point at which (supply equals demand) in a market is called the equilibrium point .  Geometrically, the equilibrium point is the piont where the graph of supply and demand intersect.  Suppose the price and demand for an item are related by where is the price in dollars and is the number of items demanded in hundreds. Suppose also that price and supply are related by where is again price in dollars and is quantity supplied in hundreds. Find the equilibrium price and quantity. The equilibrium price and quantity occurs when . We solve: To solve this equation it is best to use the quadratic formula: Substitute the correct values for , and for homework. You should find two solutions:   which we can disregard (why?)   which is a valid solution for this problem  So, the equilibrium quantity is or 300 items and the equilibrium price is or $96. In other words, this market is in equilibrium (supply equls demand) when 300 items are supplied at price of $96. Notice that , the equilibrium point, is the intersection point of the graphs of and .     Researchers conducted a market study to track how changes in technology and climate affected the sales of gas powered cars on Echo Island. They found that the number of gas powered cars in tens sold in a month is given by where represents the number of months after the study began. How many months into the study did gas powered cars reach their maximum sales? What was the maximum number of cars sold in a month during the study? Since , the quadratic does indeed have a maximum value. We need the vertex: and so that the vertex is . Therefore, the maxmimum number of gas powered cars sold on Echo Island occurred 4 months after the study. The maximum number sold was 769 cars.

Notation: is read approaches (NOT equals). For instance is read approaches 1, . There are two directions to approach 1 on the number line (from the left aned from the right), and the notation indicates that the two-sided approach is being considered. However, there is also notation to use if you only want to consider a one-sided approach .  approach from the left; , which is denoted   approach from the right; , which is denoted   The plus and minus symbols, - and +, in the superscript DO NOT indicate the sign of the values. They simply indicate the direction of the approach. See the picture below.    Observe that is the same as   In the next three examples ( , , and ) we will use data charts and graphs to investigate what happens to the given function as   Let . Let's investigate what happens to the values as . First we look at a data chart:    Even though data charts only allow us to guess what will happen, it seems reasonable to conclude from the above table that as . This is because the values approach the SAME NUMBER (which is 2) as approaches 1 from BOTH SIDES. Let's see if we can make the same conclusion looking at the graph.    Looking at the graph we come to same conclusion. As from either side the corresponding points on the graph of move (indicated by the dotted arrows) towards the point . Looking at the axis (which is where we find the values) we see that whether approaches 1 from the left or right, . Note also that so we actually have as .   Let . Let's investigate what happens to the values as . For homework make a data chart as in . You should again conclude that as   Let's take a look at the graph. Notice that is not in the domain of this function. So, we cannot evaluate as in the previous example. This also means there will not be a point on the graph above on the graph of . However, because does not require evaluation at , it still makes sense to talk about what happens as approaches 1 since is defined for every close to 1. Below is the graph.    Notice that our conclusion is the same as in the previous example. Also observe the similarities between the two graphs. This happens because In other words for every value of except , which is why both functions approach the same value as . The difference this time is that is NOT defined. So, again we as , but this time is UNDEFINED.    Let's again investigate what happens as , this time to the piecewise function Below is a data chart as in . Make sure you understand how the values are calculated.    The issue here is that as the values do not approach one unique number. For near 1 (considering both sides of 1), the values are separated by a distance of just over 2 units:  as , the data shows that   as , the data shows that   Looking at the graph, we expect the two pieces of to be separated along the vertical line .     Let be a fixed real number. We say the limit of the function is the number if all the values can be made arbitrarily close to the number by making sufficiently close to . We denote this by writing   Recall that is the same as . Sometimes it is convenient to look at limits in which approaches from only one direction. These are called one-sided limit and are denoted   for the left-sided limit and   for the right-sided limit .     Facts :  Limits of functions do not always exist. When they do, they are unique (in other words, a function cannot have more than one limit as ).   if and only if .    The second fact above is useful in determining the existence (or lack of existence) of limits for piecewise functions as in above. It says that the two-sided limit exists if and only if both one-sided limits exist and equal the same number. If a limit does not exist we write DNE.  Returning to our examples we can express our findings as follows:   (and recall ) ( )   (and recall was UNDEFINED) ( )   DNE since (and recall ) ( )  For , the two-sided limit DNE because even though the one-sided limits both exist, they do not equal the same number. It also interesting to note that although DNE in this example, we can still evaluate at to get , while in  but was UNDEFINED. This highlights the difference between taking a limit and function evaluation. The function in (in which ) has a very nice property which allow us to calculate its limit using direct substitution.  Relying on numerical tables and graphs is a nice way to gain some insight as to whether a limit exists or not, and what that limit may be. A more dependable approach, however, is needed. For most of our applications we will be interested in the case when we can use direct substitution to obtain the limit; either immediately or after some algebraic reduction of the problem. The following properties of limits give us circumstances under which this is possible.   Algebraic Limits - Limit Laws   Let be any real number, a natural number, and suppose that and both exist for some constant . Then ...               provided that      (assume exists as a real number)   (direct substitution)   (direct substitution) (assume exists as a real number)    Two important consequences of the above limit properties:  If is any polynomial ( ) and is any real number then (direct substitution).  If is the quotient of two polynomials and is in its domain then (direct substitution).        (Why could we use direct substitution to calculate this limit?)     (Why could we use direct substitution to calculate this limit?)     (What property above allowed us to calculate this limit so easily?)     Notice that direct substitution leads to division by 0, which is undefined. This, as we know, does not mean the limit DNE (we found this limit to be 2 - see ). To calculate this limit algebraically, we have to do a little algebra first. Recall our work from above in which we found so that The idea with problems like this is to reduce the function to the point where you can use direct substitution to evaluate the limit.     "

There are two types of rates of change we will consider:   Average Rate of Change (AROC)    Instantaneous Rate of Change (IROC)     To distinguish between these concepts, consider how your position in a vehicle changes with respect to time traveled. Suppose you drove 130 miles in hours (say from 1 pm to 3 pm). Then you drove an average of . So, is the AROC of your position over the time interval . On the other hand, suppose you look at your speedometer at 2 pm ( hour into your trip) and it reads . Then your IROC at hour into your trip is .  Suppose represents the number of backpacks sold in thousands by ADTF Distributors when they spend hundred dollars on advertising, valid for The graph of is given below.    How many backpacks did ADTF Distributors sell as a result of increasing spending on advertising from $100 to $400? For an increase of spending from $100 to $400 we look at what happens as increases from 1 to 4. In this case we see that increases from 2 to 3.51. Since 3.51 - 2 = 1.51 we find that ADTF Distributors sold an additional 1,510 backpacks as a result of increasing the amount spent on advertising from $100 to $400.   As money spent on advertising increased from $100 to $400, what was the average number of backpacks sold per hundred dollar increase? We need to determine the average change in as increases from 1 to 2, then 2 to 3, and finally 3 to 4. Respectively, these changes are 3-2=1, 3.5-3 = .5, and 3.51 - 3.5 = .01. The average of these three numbers is Alternatively, this is is the same as as finding over the interval  We conclude that as money spent on advertising increased from $100 to $400, ADTF Distributors' sales increased on average by approximately 503 backpacks per hundred dollar increase spent on advertising. This number is average rate of change of as goes from 1 to 4. That is,      Observe that the slope of the line through the points and in is the same as the AROC of over the interval . A line that goes through two specified points on the graph of a function, as does, is called a secant line . Note that every AROC is the slope of some secant line (and vice versa).  The average rate of change (AROC) of as goes from to is given by which is also the slope of the secant line through the points and .  For future work with derivatives, let's change the labeling in the AROC formula. Assume and that there are units of distance in between and (we are assuming here). Let so that . Then the AROC formula in the above definition becomes The quantity on the right is another way to express the AROC of and is also called the difference quotient of . As before, it still represents the slope of the secant line through and . Below is a graph illustrating both versions of the AROC formula and the corresponding secant line.    Let . Find the AROC of as goes from -1 to 3 using . With and we have Remember, this is a rate of change, so given a context, the units would be:    Let .

  "body": " Instantaneous Rate Of Change and the Derivative  As mentioned before, the concept of slope of a line and rate of change are equivalent ( by ). The instantaneous rate of change (IROC) of a function at a fixed value is the same as the slope of the tangent line at the point . Let's call this line . This line ``touches\" the graph of at the point and has the same ``direction\" as the graph at the point .    Notice how similar the graph of and the graph of are NEAR the point . Because they are so similar, we can use the slope of (which is the IROC of at ) to approximate how will increase or decrease as increases by one unit. :  To find the slope of the tangent line at the point , let be the secant line through the points and . Let's suppose . Keep making smaller and smaller and smaller and smaller (that is, let ), and each time you pick a smaller value for , draw another secant line through and . You will end up with infinitely many secant lines (one for each value of ) that get closer and closer to having the slope of the tangent line. Look at the picture below, where only three of these lines are drawn. Starting at , was made smaller to get to , and then smaller still to get to . Notice how these lines approach the tangent line .    Each one of these secant lines has slope where gets closer and closer and closer and closer (you get the idea) to 0. So, the slope of the tangent line, , is found by taking a limit: Remember this is also the IROC of at . That is,   The derivative of the function , denoted as or , is given by provided the limit exists. If the limit does not exits, we say is non-differentiable at .  So, if has a derivative at a fixed value , then    A Comment About Notation:   Note that there are two forms of notation for the derivative: (read `` prime of \") is Sir Isaac Newton's notation and (read ``d d \"; this is NOT a fraction) is Gottfried Leibniz's notation. They both represent the derivative defined above. You should become familiar working with both. We can also express the derivative as . For evaluation at , we write , or in case we're using Liebniz notation, we write . The vertical bar is called an evaluation bar .  Our biggest application of the derivative will be its use as an IROC. In light of the discussion at the start of this section, for a fixed value of in the domain of , gvies us an approximation of how changes as the given -value increases by one unit.  Suppe represent's ADTF Distributors' cost (in dollars) for bookends produced and sold by the company. Interpret . Let's first assign units to this value. Since is cost given in dollars, and is bookends produced and sold, the units for the derivative are: Since the value of the derivative is negative, the interpretation is: When ADTF Distributors produces and sells bookends, their cost is decreasing at a rate of per additional bookend produced and sold. In other words, tells us that will decrease by approximately from production of the bookend. Notice that the derivative, , gives us information about the original cost function, .    Let's practice working with the definition of the derivative. When you are asked to find a derivative using the definition , this is the procedure to follow:  Find the derivative of the following functions using the definition of the derivative.    Let's first simplify the difference quotient. Most of the time, that just means simplify until you can cancel the in the denominator: Now, when we take the limit as goes to 0, we can just substitute 0 in for (since we can view the simplified difference quotient as a polynomial in ). So, That is, the derivative of is .     Let's first simplify the difference quotient. Again, we will work until we can cancel the in the denominator of the difference quotient. Now, when we take the limit as goes to 0, we can just substitute 0 in for (since we can view the simplified difference quotient as a rational function in for which is defined). So, That is, the derivative of is .     Let . Find and interpret . Then find the tangent line to at . From the previous example, we know that . So, which means: When , decreases at an approximate rate of 3 units per unit increase in . To find the tangent line, we need a point and a slope. Notice that we use fo find the point, and fo find the slope.   A point is   slope =   So, the tangent line is See the graph of and it's tangent line at below.

As we have learned, gives us the instantaneous rate of change of . Recall that when we interpret a value of the derivative, we mention that is increasing if is positive or that is decreasing if is negative. This applies to the graph of as well.        In general, it is not easy to algebraically determine on what intervals a function is increasing or decreasing. Fortunately, we can use the sign of the derivative to make this job much simpler.   Let represent an open interval.

The graph below indicates how we can use the sign of the derivative, along with the places where the derivative is equal to 0, to find these ``peaks\" and ``valleys.\"    In general, if we know , and the sign of the derivative changes from negative to positive in some small neighborhood containing , then will be a ``valley\" on the graph of ( this is because these sign changes of the derivative tell us that changes from decreasing to increasing, and so must ``bottom out\" at ).

The reason is because does not have a unique tangent line (or unique direction) at these points. This scenario is not as important as the one above for our applications of the derivative, but you should be aware of difference. See the picture below for an illustration.    Notice that in the 2 graphs above, and , the relative extreme values occurred in places where the derivative was 0 (that is, where there was a horizontal tangent line), or where the derivative was undefined (no unique tangent line).

In light of the above fact, if we want to find relative extreme values of function, the only places we need look are at the critical numbers. This is good news, because most functions we work with will not have more than a few critical numbers.

  "body": " The Second Derivative  If a function has a first derivative, , then we may ask if is differentiable. If so, we call the derivative of the second derivative of and denote it by or . Of course, we can continue to check the differentiability of successive derivatives. These successive derivatives are called higher order derivatives of . The notation for these higher order derivatives is given below. Notice that beyond order three, the \"prime\" notation changes and the order of the derivative is indicated by the number in parenthesis.  First derivative:   Second derivative:   Third Derivative:   Fourth Derivative:   Fifth Derivative:     Find all derivatives of . For each derivative, we can use the power rule:              Each successive derivative will also be 0. That is, for all .   One application of the second derivative is that will give the instantaneous rate of change of . This has geometric consequences. Concavity is related to the rate of change of a function's derivative which can be found by looking at the sign of the second derivative. A function is concave up where the first derivative, , is increasing (that is, where ), and concave down where the first derivative, , is decreasing (that is, where ). A point where concavity changes is called an inflection point . Geometrically, a function is concave up on intervals where the graph \"bends up\", or is above its tangent lines. The function is concave down on intervals where the graph \"bends down\", or is below its tangent lines.        Notice that in the picture on the left, the slopes of tangent lines get larger from left to right. In other words, the deriviate increases, which means the second derivative is positive. In the picture on the right, the slopes of tangent lines get smaller from left to right. In other words, the deriviate decreases, which means the second derivative is negative. Again, an inflection point is a point where concavity changes. That is, a point about which changes sign.    xref ref=\"inflection-point\"> If corresponds to an inflection point for the function , then either or is NOT DEFINED at .   We can use a sign chart for the second derivative to find inflection points in a similar way that we used a sign chart for the first derivative to find relative extreme values. We find places where the second derivative is zero, put that value on a number line, and check the sign of the second derivative on either side. If the sign changes (that is, if concavity changes) from one side to the other, then we have an inflection point.  This information is summarized in the Concavity Test : Suppose is such that and exist for all in the interval .  If on , then is concave up on .  If on , then is concave down on   Furthermore, if is an inflection point of , then either or does not exist.  Concavity and inflection points are related to the law of diminishing returns in economics. This law states that in all productive processes, adding more of one factor of production will at some point yield lower incremental per-unit returns. A point of diminishing returns refers to a point at which the optimal level of capacity is reached, where incremental increases in the input result in smaller increases in output. Mathematically, a point of diminishing returns is an inflection point through which the function increases and its derivative changes from increasing to decreasing (or equivalently, where the second derivative changes from positive to netagive).

Then is the absolute maximum value of if for every in the domain of . Similarly, is the absolute minimum value of if for every in the domain of .  See the graph below for a comparison of relative and absolute extreme values of .    Notice that in the above graph does indeed have a largest ( ) and smallest ( ) output value. It is those values we are interested in finding. Observe that the absolute maximum occurred at an endpoint of the graph, and not a \"peak,\" so to speak. In other words, we have an absolute maximum value of that is NOT a relative maximum value of (relative extreme values cannot occur at endpoints). On the other hand, is both an absolute and relative minimum. Notice that in this case, the absolute minimum value of occurred at a critical number inside the interval .  Not every function will have an absolute maximum and\/or absolute minimum value (for instance, think of on the entire real line). The following theorem tells us when we can be certain these absolute extreme values exist.   Extreme Value Theorem  A continuous function on a closed, bounded interval will have an absolute maximum value and an absolute minimum value on that interval.   In \"continuous function\" means that the function has no jumps or holes in its graph. All polynomials are continuous everywhere. \"Closed, bounded interval\" means the interval contains its endpoints and both endpoints are finite values. In other words, intervals of the form , where and are both real numbers, . The above theorem tells us that every polynomial will have absolute extreme values on every closed and bounded interval.  Below are some pictures illustrating why it is necessary that be continuous and the interval be closed and bounded for to be guaranteed to have absolute extreme values.        The Extreme Value Theorem tells us when we can expect a function to have absolute extreme values. Below are a couple useful results that will help us find them.   If is continuous on and is an absolute extreme value, then , , or is a critical number between and (see the first graph above).   This fact tells us that under the assumptions of , the absolute extreme values can only occur at critical numbers or endpoints of intervals.

If is a relative minimum, then is an absolute minimum.     Find the absolute extreme values of on .  is a polynomial defined on the closed bounded interval , so must have absolute extreme values by . To find them, we first get the critical numbers of . Since , which gives as the only critical value. By , all we need to do to find the absolute extreme values is evaluate at the critical number, the endpoints of the interval, and compare:           So, is the absolute maximum and is the absolute minimum.

What price should Fawlty Towers charge to maximize profit? What is the maximuum profit? Write a sentence interpreting your answer. We are asked to find the absolute maximum value of Fawlty Towers' profit function, . We begin by determing the price, , and quantity, , models for room rentals.

Since we are not given any fixed costs, the cost model, , is With revenue and cost determined, Finally, we determine that absolute maximum value of on the interval . As usual, we need the critical value of . We solve so that is the only critical number of . Since , the second derivative test tells us that gives a relative maximum.

  "body": " Area And The Definite Integral  We now explore the application of area to solving problems involving the total change (or net change or total accumulation ) in a function. Recall , in which Farbman's cost, , was increasing at a constant rate of $92.47 per additional unit manufactured ( ). We found the cost function to be so that the total, or net, change in cost the company incurs between the third and seventh dresser they manufacture is , or $369.88. Notice the region under the marginal cost function over the interval forms a rectangle of height 92.47 and width of 4. So, the area of this region is .      Total Change In  : Suppose is continuous on the interval , and is the rate of change of (this means , or is antiderivative of ). Then the total change in as goes from to is the area between the graph of and the -axis from to .   In the picture above, the region under is a rectangle, and so we have a nice formula to calculate the area. Of course, the above fact is also true for more complicated curves. Suppose instead that Farbman's marginal cost is given to be and again we want to know the total change in cost between the third and seventh dresser. That is, we want to know . tells us     So, how do we calculate this area? Well, we know how to calculate the area of rectangles, so let's start there.  Left Endpoint Approximation    In the above picture, the interval is divided into 4 smaller intervals, called subintervals, the length of each being 1 unit. This is the width of each rectangle, for . Notice that for the height of each rectangle we used the marginal cost value at the left endpoint of each of the 4 smaller intervals. If denotes the area of for , then              Now, the area under , or in other words, the total change in cost from to is approximately   It is worthwhile pointing out here that the choice to use the left endpoints of the subintervals to form our rectangles was arbitrary. We could have have evaluated the marginal cost function at any number we like within each subinterval to determine the height of the rectangles. We also could have arbitrarily chosen the width of each rectanlge. Below are two more illustrations using the right endpoint and midpoint of each interval to determine the height.  Right Endpoint Approximation    Midpoint Approxmiation    That the left and right endpoint approximations are the same is coincidence. Most often, choosing different test points to determine the height of the approximating rectangles will give different area approximations. Regardless, we can make these approximations better and better by continuing to increase the number of inscribed rectangles. The sum of the areas of these approximating rectangles is referred to as a Riemann Sum . Look how close we can approximate the acutal area using only 40 rectangles. This, of course, provides a better approximaition of the total change in .    Letting denote the area of each rectangle, and using summation notation for the Riemann Sum ,   Let represent the number of rectangles we use. Then the Riemann Sum has the form The actual area under the graph of is the LIMIT of the Riemann Sums as . Again, recalling  We have a special notation for the limit above. The symbol is used for the above limit, and is referred to as a definite integral . The numbers 3 and 7 at the bottom and top of the integral symbol are called limits of integration . Substituting and rewriting, this becomes   In the next section we will learn how to evaluate these definite integrals without having to calcuate a limit.  "

Using , the accumulated maintenance cost for a 4 year lease is We find that the accumulated maintenance cost Kramerica can expect from a 4 year lease is $2,200. Since there are 48 months in this lease period, rounding up to cover all costs, Kramerica should add about $45.84 a montth to fully cover maintenance fees. Below is the graph which illustrates the value of the definite integral as area under .     DDX, a company specializing in podcasts and other audio content, decided to increase their monthly subscription fee from $3.25 to $6.75 in hopes of increasing their revenue. They expected to lose some customers, but hoped to retain enough of them to make up for that lost revenue. It turned out that the rate of change of the total number of subscribers is modeled by hundreds of subscribers per month, where is the number of months since the fee was increased.  Find the total change in the number of subscribers over the first 7 months after they increased the subscription fee. Let be the function that gives DDX's subscribers (in hundreds) months after the fee was increased (that is, ). We are asked to find . Notice that since a loss of subscribers is expected, we should expect . Using , which is less than 0, indicating a loss of subscribers as expected. As a result of increasing their monthly subscription fee from $3.25 to $6.75, DDX lost 30,800 subscribers in the first 7 months. Below is the graph which relates the value of the definite integral to the area between and .     Suppose DDX had 135,000 subscribers before they increased they their fees. Determine if DDX's strategy succeeded in increasing revenue after these 7 months have passed. Prior to the increase, DDX's revenue from monthly subscriptions was 135,000(3.25) = $438,750. Seven months afte the increae, DDX's revenue was (135,000 - 30,800)(6.75) = $703,350. So, increasing the monthly subscription fee caused a decrease of 30,800 in subscribers, but generated an additional $264,600 in revenue. So, their stragety was successful.      Area Between Curves   As a natural consequence of the geometric interpretation of the definite integral we have the following:  If and are integrable over the interval and for all in then the area, , between and over the interval is     Be aware that if the functions intersect at some value in the interval , and for in and for in , then two integrals are needed to find the total area, , trapped by and over the interval . The area would be This is illustated in the graph below. Notice that is the sum of two regions of area, , where and     We will see this idea illustrated in the following examples.  The rate at which revenue was generated over time by VL Consultants is millions of dollars per year, valid for where corresponds to the start of the year 1990. The rate at which costs were incurred is given by millions of dollars per year. Find VL Consultants' total profit from the start of 1994 to the start of 2004. Let represent VL Consultant's total profit function. Then we are asked to find (note that corresponds to the start of 1994 and corresponds to the start of 2004). Since , by  VL Consultants' total profit from the start of 1994 to the start of 2004 was $364,000,000. You should be able to verify algebraically that for all in . So, the definite integral above is the area between and from to . Below is the graph illustrating the value of the definite integral as the area between these two models.     Puddy's Auto Shop recently purchased a new hydraulic lift, engine crane, and electronic diagnostic equipment. Throughout the first nine years of use, the new equipment has an associated rate of savings given by tens of dollars per year the equipment is used (so, is in years). Also throughout the first nine years of use, the equipment has an operating expense with an associated rate of cost given by tens of dollars per year the equipment is in use.  Determine how long the the new equipment should be used to maximize savings. Obsere that initially the rate of savings is greater than the rate of cost. However, the rate of savings declines with time, while the rate of cost increase with time. We need to determine how long it will take the rate of cost to catch up to the rate of savings. To do this we solve Since represtents years, the only valid solution is and we conclude that to maximize savings, Puddy's Auto Shop should use the equiment for 7 years. The graph below shows that and intersect at .     Determine Puddy's net, maximal savings from using the new equipment. To do this, we subtract the rate of cost of using the new equipment from the rate of savings associated with using the new equipment. This function, , will give the rate of net savings. Using our answer from the previous part, to determine the net, maximal savings, we integrate from to to obtain: where the answer above is rounded to one decimal place. We see that Puddy's net, maximal savings from using the new equipment is $2,659. Geometrically, this is the area between and over , as depicted below.        Consumer and Producer Surplus    Consumer surplus (CS) is a measure of the benefit consumers gain when they are willing to pay more than the market price.    For individual consumers, this is simply a difference in dollar amounts. With respect to the market, it's found by calculating the area under the demand curve and above the market price.   Producer surplus (PS) is a measure of the benefit producers gain when they are willing to supply an item for less than the market price.    With respect to the market, this is found by calculating the area under the market price and above the supply curve.  Both consumer surplus (CS) and producer surplus (PS) at equlibrium are represented as area in the graph below. The demand model is the function while supply is represented by . Observe is the equilibrium point so that is the equilibrium quantity and gives the market equilbrium price.    We compute consumer and producer surplus using definite integrals as follows:  Consumer Surplus = CS =   Producer Surplus = PS =     Equivalently,  Consumer Surplus = CS =   Producer Surplus = PS =   where is the revenue at equilibrium and and are referred to as the definite integral portions of consumer and producer surplus respectively. Note also that is often used to represent the market equilibrium point instead of .  ADTF Distributors finds that the demand function for their new snow blower can be expressed as dollars, where is the number of snow blowers. Similarly, the supply function is dollars, where is the number of snow blowers.  Find the eqilibrium point, , for this market and use it to calculate ADTF Distributors' revenue at equilibrium. Since will be the point where supply and demand intersect, we solve Using the quadratic formula we find one valid solution: . Since , the equilibrium point is . Thus, this market is in equlibrium (supply equals demand) when 25 snow blowers are supplied at a price $77. Hence, the ADTF Distributors' reveune at equilibrium is (77)(25) = $1,925.   Compute the consumer surplus at equilibrium for these snow blowers. Since is the equilibrium quantity, and gives the equilibrium price, the consumer surplus is which we can simplify and evaluate. However, let's find the consumer surplus by first evaluating the integral portion, and then use our answer from the previous part. Now, Since we find that the consumer surplus in this market is 5,675-1,925 = 3,750. So, when supply and demand are at equilibrium, the consumer surplus for the sale of the new snow blowers will be $3,750.   Compute the producer surplus at equilibrium for these snow blowers. Since is the equilibrium quantity, and gives the equilibrium price, the consumer surplus is which we can simplify and evaluate. However, let's find the producer surplus by first evaluating the integral portion, and then use our answer from the previous part. Now, Since we find that the producer surplus in this market is 1,925-1,425 = 500. So, when supply and demand are at equilibrium, ADTF Distributors will have a producer surplus of $500.   Graph and .

  "body": " Interest Models   Simple Interest  Exponential functions are commonly used to model the growth and decay of money. But, let's first revisit a topic introduced in for comparison. In particular, recall .   Simple Interest is interest computed only on the principal amount invested or borrowed. For this reason, when money grows (or declines) according to a simple interest model, it does so linearly.  Let   = principal dollar amount invested or borrowed   = yearly interest rate (as a decimal)   = number of years  Then is the amount of (simple) interest earned (or owed) in years. Notice that this is a linear model with vertical intercept and slope . You should be aware that may represent a unit of time other than years, such as days, weeks, months, etc. So, pay attention to the given context for the appropriate units. However, unless otherwise mentioned, we will assume to be in years.  Maggie borrowed $4,000 at 3% simple interest for 9 months. How much interest will she pay? How much will Maggie owe in 9 months? We use the simple interest formula with   and     so that our model for this problem is In years, So, Maggie will pay $90 in simple interest. In 9 months she will owe her principal and interest, which is    The total amount owed in is referred to as a future value . In other words, $4,090 is the future value, , of $4,000 invested at 3% simple interest for 9 nine months. In general, the future value , , of a principal amount dollars in years at a simple interest rate (as a decimal) is   Notice that we can solve this expression above for the principal amount (or present value) if we know the future value :    Summary of Simple Interest Formulas   Future Value:   Interest:   Present Value:   Notice that in this context is the principal amount invested or borrowed, and the present value. The future value is sometimes referred to as the maturity value.  Randy borrows $73,000 at 6% simple interest per year for 90 days. Find the maturity value. We use the future value formula above with      and   .  Substituting these values Randy will owe a total of $74,080 in 90 days. That is, $74,080 is the future value of $73,000 at 6% simple interest for 90 days.   Larry owes $6,500 to Margaret. The loan is payable in one year at 5\\% simple interest. Margaret needs cash immediately, so she decides to sell the loan to a bank 4 months before it is due. The bank wants an 8% return. How much should the bank pay? We first need to determine the amount the bank will get when the loan is paid off. That is, we need the future value of the $6,500 Margaret loaned to Larry. This is what the bank will receive at the end of the year. We use . $6,825 is the amount the bank will get when the year is up in 4 months. To determine what they should pay in order to get an 8% return, we need the present value, , of $6,890 at 8% simple interest for four months. To calculate this, we use . The bank should pay $6,647.73 to get an 8% return on the loan they purchase from Margaret.   Treasury Bills, or T-bills, often involve simple interest calculations. A T-bill is a simple discount loan , meaning the interest is deducted in advance of the loan, but the full value of the loan must be repaid. T-bills are short term discount loans by investors, backed by the U.S. Treasury Department.  An investor bought a 10 month, $400 T-bill that sold at a simple discount rate of 3%. Find the interest earned on the T-bill, the price of the T-bill, and the simple interest rate the Treasury paid. Using with , the interest is calculated as . So the interest the investor earned on the T-bill is $10. Since the interest is deducted in advance of the loan, we calculate The price of the T-bill is $390. To find the interest rate will solve for , using and : Rounding to three decimal places, the simple interest rate paid by the Treasury was 3.077%.     Compound Interest   Compound interest is interest on both the initial principal and the accumulated interest from previous periods. Because of this, compound interest is calculated using exponential models. Under the same interest rate, compound interest will make an amount of money grow faster than simple interest, which is calculated only on the principal amount (recall that simple interest is linear).  Let   = principal dollar amount invested or borrowed   = yearly or annual interest rate (as a decimal)   = number of compounding periods per year   = number of years    Consider principal amount $ accumulating interest for compounding periods per year at an annual interest rate of . Note that in this case, the interest per period is . What will this amount grow to by the end of the year under compound interest?   Amount at end of first period:   This amount now collects interest during the second period. That is, this is the \"new\" principal amount for periond 2.    Amount at end of second period:   This amount now collects interest during the third period. That is, this is the \"new\" principal amount for periond 3.    Amount at end of third period:   This amount now collects interest during the fourth period. That is, this is the \"new\" principal amount for periond 4.   This process continues more times. By the end of the year, this amount will have grown to   Using the notation described above, let be the model that gives the dollar amount after years under compound interest. Then    is the future value of the principal in years. So, we will sometimes write and call the present value. Just like with simple interest, we can write the above model in present and future value form.   Summary of Compund Interest Formulas  For principal amount $ invested or borrowed at an annual interest rate of with compounding periods per year, in years we have   Future Value =   Interest earned =   Present Value =     Sam is planning to open a bar and grill in Boston, MA in 54 months. He invests $28,500 in account that pays 3.5% interest compounded quarterly. How much money will Sam have by the time he is ready to open his bar? How much interest will he have earned? We us with , , and . The compound interest model is then Since 54 months corresponds to years, we evaluate When Sam opens his bar in 54 months, his investment will have grown to $33,338.70. Hence, Sam will have earned $33,338.70 - $28,500 = $4,838.70 in interest.   Coach Pantusso needs $2,500 in 18 months for equipment for his little league baseball teams. He finds an account offering 5.75% interest compounded monthly. How much should Coach invest so that he has enough money to purchase the equipment? How much interest did he earn? To determine now much Coach should invest, we use given a future value in years of with interest and compounding periods per year. Coach needs to invest $2,293.88 so that he has enough money to purchase the equipment. In this case he will earn $2,500 - $2,293.88 = $206.12 interest.

We use (with present value corresponding to early 2020) given a future value in years (the year 2023) of with interest and (for inflation, the compounding is 1 time a year). An item that sold for $1,000 at the beginning of 2023 cost $943.71 at the start of 2020.  We now want to determine the doubling time under this inflation rate. To do this, we solve for , using and  Rounding up, it will take about 36 years for this price to double. Observe that this doubling time is independent of cost of the item. An item that cost $1 would also take about 36 years until the price doubled.    Carla and Eddie managed to save $11,559.23 for their wedding. They invested $10,000 at an annual interest rate of 7.25% compounded weekly. For how long did they invest thier money? How many compounding periods were there in this time. We solve for , using and , , and . Carla and Eddie invested their money for 2 years with a total of compounding periods.     Continuous Compounding  Let's look at the effect of increasing the number of yearly compounding periods on an investment. For simplicity, suppose $1 is invested at an annual interest rate of 100% for year, compounded times a year. For our calculations we use with . The future value of $1 at year is then Let's look at how $1 grows as we increase . We round to the nearest cent:   (yearly):    (semiannual):    (quarterly):    (monthly):    (weekly):    (daily):   We can continue to increase the number of compounding periods by letting . Recalling , we have We obtain similar results using any interest rate. Indeed, for any value one can show Using the properties of limits, we can continue to extend the above result. For the compound interest model , we obtain the following by letting the number of compounding perionds increase without bound:   The continuous compounding model is the result of letting the number of yearly compounding periods tend to infinity in the compound interest model. As we observed above, if we let the number of yearly compounding periods, , tend to infinity in the model given in , then we obtain the continuous compounding model where as before, is the principal amount invested or borrowed, is the annual interest rate as a decimal, and is time in years. As with our other interest models, continous compounding has a future and present value form. The present value form is found by rewriting the above model in terms of .   Continuous Compounding Formulas  For principal amount $ invested or borrowed at an annual interest rate of with compounding periods per year, in years we have   Future Value =   Interest earned =   Present Value =     Norm, Cliff, and Woody are saving money to travel cross county on a snipe hunt. They decide to invest their money with Howe's Investment Firm, which is the only finanacial establishment they could only find that offered accounts with continuous compounding.  How much will Norm, Cliff, and Woody have if they invest $750 in an account with interest rate 3.86% compounded continuously for 15 months? How much did they earn in interest? Using with the given information, the continous compouding model is Evaluating at years gives In 15 months, Norm, Cliff, and Woody will have $787.07. This means they earned $787.07 - $750 = $37.07 in interest.   If the desired amount in 15 months is $977, how much should Norm, Cliff, and Woody invest? If they let this investment grow for an additional 6 months, how much interest would they earn.  Using with , and , If Norm, Cliff, and Woody want $977 in 15 months, they should invest $930.98 in the account.  In this case their their continuous compounding model is If they let their investment grow for an additional 6 months, then evaluating at gives In this case, Norm, Cliff, and Woody would earn $996.04 - $930.98 = $65.06 in interest.      Jaco wants to buy a new bass guitar which costs $1,799.99 plus an additional 8.7396% in tax and surcharge. He invested $1,835 in an account with continuous compounding and was able to use this money to purchase his bass 19 months after his deposit. What was Jaco's interest rate? First, including tax and surcharge, Jaco's bass cost $1,799.99(1+.087396) = $1,957.30 (rounded to the nearest cent). To determine the account's interest rate, we can use with , , and to solve for the interest rate, : Jaco's account had an interest rate of 4.075%.   Suppose $P is invested.  If the money is earning 6.21% compounded continuously, how long will it take the investment to increase by 50%. We use with and to solve for . It will take approximately 6.5 years (or about 6 years and 6 months) for the investment to increase by 50%.   Under the same conditions, how long will it take the investment to double? We use with and to solve for . It will take approximately 11.16 years (or about 11 years and 2 months) for the investment to double.   If the value of the investment decreases (or decays) continuously at rate 5.53%, how long will it take for the investment to decrease to half its value? We use with to solve for . Because the value of the investemet is decaying, however, we must use . It will take approximately 12.5 years (or about 12 years and 6 months) for the investment to decay to half its value.       APR and APY   APR (the annual percentage rate) , also called the nominal rate , represents the stated yearly interest rate. While we will also use this term for investments, it is often used as the rate charged for borrowing money, including fees. APR does not take into consideration the number of compounding periods per year. For our purposes, it would be like the rate used in all our interest models above.   APY (the annual percentage yield) , also called the effective rate , describes the interest rate under the effect of compounding periods. Because APY includes a calculation of how compounded interest impacts the rate over the course of one year, the APY will usually be larger than the APR. Also, the greater the number of yearly compounding periods, the bigger the difference between the APR and APY.  Suppose we are given an APR (annual interest rate) of compounded times a year. Then in years $P will grow according to the compound interest model The associated APY is the (actual) growth rate of this exponential model. Rewriting the above model, and we see that is a base exponential growth model. Recall . The (actual) growth rate, or APY, associated with is , or This value is the associated APY and for a fixed APR, will incease as increases.  With an APR (or annual interest rate) of compounded times a year, the APY (annual percentage yield, or effective rate) , denoted , is In the case of continuous compounding, the APY is   For example, suppose $ is invested at an annual rate (APR) of 2.5%. The APY is the (actual) growth rate of this investment, which increase with the compounding periods:  Quarlterly compounding:   Montly compounding:   Daily compounding:   Continuous compounding:     Because the APY gives the (actual) growth rate of an investment, it can be used to determine which account provides a better investment option.  Chambers and Crane Investment Bank is offering Account 1 with an APR of 3.245% compounded semiannually and Account 2 with an APR 3.223% compounded weekly. Which is the better investment option. While Account 1 has a higher APR, Account 2 offers more compounding periods. To compare, we find the APY (or (actual) growth rate) for each account.  Account 1   Account 2   Since the APY for Account 2 (3.274%) is highter than the APY for Account 1 (3.271%), Account 2 is the better investment option. In other words, Account 2 is the better investment option since it offers a higher growth rate.    "

  "body": " Ordinary Annuities  An annuity is a sequence of equal payments made at equal time periods (unlike one-time deposits or payments like we previously considered). An ordinary annuity is an annuity in which the payments are made to the account at the end of each period .  Because annuities involve a sequence of payments, determining the future value of an annuity can involve adding a large number of terms together, which can be extremely tedious. Fortunately, using some algebra, we can find a nice formula to make our work much easier. So we begin with some albegra.  As a an example, consider the following equality. For any real number , we have, When this is equivalent to Similarly  and so on. What will be useful to us here, is that the sum on the left can be computed using division. In general, the following is true:   For any natural number and real number ,    Now, suppose we deposit $ at the end of each period for total compounding periods at an interest rate of each period. Note that is NOT necessarily the annual rate. To compare with our previous work, if were the annual interest rate and there were compounding periods per year, then we would use as the interest rate per period. In other words, using our new notation, we can rewrite our compound interest model as follows. For principal , compounded times a year for years at an annual interest rate  Now, using our compound interest model, with $ deposited at the end of each period,  Accumulated amount from deposit 1 =   Accumulated amount from deposit 2 =   Accumulated amount from deposit 3 =      Accumulated amount from deposit m-3 =   Accumulated amount from deposit m-2 =   Accumulated amount from deposit m-1 =   Accumulated amount from deposit m =     Let represent the future value of this ordinary annuity. Then will equal the sum of all these accumulated amounts. Therefore, if we let and use  Substituting back into this expression gives the following ordinary annuity formula.   Suppose $ is deposited (or paid) at the end of each of total periods at an interest rate of per period. Then the future value, , of this ordinary annuity is     Under these same conditions, we can rewrite the above formula in terms of to determine the periodic payments needed to reach a future value, . The payments would be determined by     This expression is often referred to as a sinking fund formula.   Suppose $200 is deposited into an account at the end of each year at 4% compounded annually. How much will be in the account in 5 years? We use the future value formula for an ordinary annuity ( ) given in with , , and . In 5 years the account will grow to $1,083.26   ADTF Distributors needs $250,000 to purchase equipemnt for their new distribution center which will be open in 3 and half years. If ADTF Distributors earns 6% compounded monthly, how much does ADTF Distributors need to deposit at the end of each month to have $250,000 in the account at the end of 3 and a half years? We use the sinking fund formula ( ) given in with , , and . ADTF Distributors need to deposit $5,364.05 at the end of each month for 42 months to have $250,000 for equipment at the end of 3 and a half years.   To build their new distribution center, ADTF Distributors had to borrow $5 million. They recently issued bonds to raise money to help pay back the $5 million they borrowed. The bonds have a face value of $5 million and are due and payable in 12 years. Assuming they earn 7.4% quarterly on their deposits, how much should ADTF Distributors deposit at the end of each quarter in order to retire the bond issue at the end of year 12. We use the sinking fund formula ( ) given in with , , and . ADTF Distributors needs to deposit $65,573.78 at the end of each quarter for 48 quarters to retire the bond issue at the end of year 12.   Cindy opens a money market at her bank that offers an annual rate of 1.11% compounded monthly. She contributes $950 a month.  How much will Cindy have in the money market at the end of year 10 years? We use the future value formula for an ordinary annuity ( ) given in with , , and . By the end of year 10, Cindy will have $120,508.87.   After the 10 years is up, Cindy decides to invest the amount from her money market annuity into another account with annual interest rate 1.24% compounded monthly. If she continues to make her monthly deposits of $950, how much will she have in her account in another 5 years? We need to do this in two steps:  First, we use the compound interest formula to determine the future value of $120,508.87. With , , and , the model we use is Evaluating at gives The amount from Cindy's previous account will grow to $128,212.80 in another 5 years.    Next we calculate the amount that will be generated by Cindy's continued deposits using the ordinary annuity formula ( given in ) with , , and . The amount generated from Cindy's continued deposits is $58,772.78    Finally, we add the two dollar amounts above to find the final value in Cindy's account:      Let's now look at the present value of an ordinary annuity . The question is, how much should be invested presently at a periodic interest rate of to ensure a payment of $ can be made from the account at the end of each of periods. To ensure $ is in the account for the first payment (here, we are viewing as the future value; in other words is playing the role of in ), must be depsoited presently. To ensure the second payment of $ (again, is the future value) is in the account by the end of the second period must be depsoited presently. To ensure the third payment of $ (again, is the future value) is in the account by the end of the third period must be depsoited presently. This pattern continues up to and including the final payment, for which must be depsoited presently to ensure the last payment can be made from the account. What we need to deposit, then, to ensure periodic payments of (at the end of each period), is Lertting and factoring a from each term, the present value, , of this ordinary annuity has the form where is the periodic pay-out amount. Using this can be rewritten as Substituting back in for gives the following:   Suppose $ is paid (or deposited) at the end of each of total periods at an interest rate of per period. Then the present value, , of this ordinary annuity is     Under these same conditions, we can rewrite the above formula in terms of to determine the periodic payments associated with an ordinary annuity with present value, . The payments would be determined by         Loan amortization is the process of paying off the interest and principal balance on a loan with regular payments over time. If the payments are made at the end of the period, then the payment formula, , for above will provide the payment amount needed to pay off a loan of $ at periodic interest rate over periods. Also observe that if both sides of the expression for above ( ) are multiplied by to find the future value of the loan under compound interest, we arrive back at the future value formula, , for an oridinary annuity.  In general, equity is defined to be total assets minus total liabilities . For a homeowner or property owener, equity would be the (market) value of the home or property less the amount still owed. To calculate the amount still owed (the outstanding debt), we view the remaining payments left on the laon as an ordinary annuity, and find its present value. This amount would be the amount still owed on the loan. Consider the following example.  H.E. Pennypacker, a wealthy American industrialist, is looking to purchase a sliver mine in the mountains of Peru. In need of loan, Pennypacker finances the entire value of the mine and borrows $500,000,000 from Varnsen Savings and Loan. The terms of the loan stipulate that Pennypacker pay an annual interest rate of 2.25% compounded monthly for 10 years.  Let's determine Pennypacker's monthly payments to Varnsen Savings and Loan. We can think of this two ways:  We can view $500,000,000 as the present value of an ordinary annuity formed by Pennypacker's sequence of payments.. In this case, using to find the amortization payments, so that Pennypacker's monthly payments are $4,656,868.59.  Using the compound interest model we find the future value of the loan to be or $626,029,455.95. Viewing this as the future value of an ordinary annuity and using to find the payments, and again we find Pennypacker's payments are $4,656,868.59.  So, if Pennypacker pays the loan in 120 monthly payments of $4,656,868.59, he will end up paying or $58,824,230.92 in interest.  Suppose that Pennypacker wants to pay off his loan halfway through the term, with 60 payments remaining. How much does Pennypacker owe Varnsen Savings and Loan? To determine the amount owed, we find the present value of the annuity defined by these 60 remaining payments using : If Pennypacker wants to pay off the laon at the end of the fifth year (after 60 payments), he owes Varnsen Savings and Loan $264,034,561.60. In this case, Pennypacker paid or $43,446,677.06 in interest.  We can also use the present value, , above to calculate Pennypacker's equity after the fifth year of the laon. Assuming that the value of the silver mine remained constant, Pennypacker's equity after his 60th payment is Pennypacker's equity after the fifth year of the laon is $235,965,438.40 or about 47%.  "
